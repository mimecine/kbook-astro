From 13" x 11" - 10.5" x 11"  
Galvanized Steel  
USA

A sap bucket to symbolize Vermont, generally understood to be the maple capital of the United States, which it is, generating 5.5% of the global supply. Quebec being le numéro un, producing an outrageous 80% of the supply. Interestingly, in Canada, maple syrup only has to be 66% maple sap in order to be labeled maple syrup, whereas in the States, you're looking at pretty much all sap to be called maple. The sap bucket at one point was a common fixture in the world of maple collection. However, today, rather than collecting from bucket to bucket, maple producers most often tap trees and run tubes from the trees straight to the sugar house where the maple is produced. If you drive around Vermont and start looking, you'll see the lines crisscrossing through maple groves. The trees need to be between 30 and 40 years old to tap. Buy a tap and try tapping a maple in your backyard or the local park (who is going to notice with all the cuts to the parks system?) and use this bucket to collect the sap, or use it to collect all sorts of sweet scraps and once pretty ideas.
