Stone  
GREECE

Crete is the next place I would like to visit in Greece. It is the largest of the Greek islands and was home to the Minoan civilization, currently the earliest recorded civilization in Europe (c. 2700 to 1420 BC). I'm reading a bit of Henry Miller now as he was so enamored with Greece. The way he writes about Crete could sell anyone on a visit. This stone you hold in your hand, or you gaze upon, comes from Crete via a small family-run knife shop in Athens. The patriarch of the family swore by this stone in particular. His directions, as passed on to us, were to add a touch of olive oil to the stone a few hours before using. I was surprised, as usually one wets a sharpening stone before using it. The reasoning is that the oil on the stone passes onto the knife blade and conditions it well. Best thing I find is to keep the stone handy and to add oil to the one side every so often, to keep it conditioned.
