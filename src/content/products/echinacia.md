2.5 oz.  
Water, Alcohol & Plant Extracts  
USA

Aaaachooo! Sniffle. Man, your nose is itchy and arms ache. You know the signs. You have to get right on it NOW and take a few drops of this in a glass of water. You remember that lady on the subway who wiped her nose on her hand and then grabbed the pole? You touched that pole. You are coming down with something. You should get home. You should drink some tea and get under the covers. You should stay warm and eat soup. You should most certainly take some of this herb every couple of hours and watch a movie in bed. It won't make you groggy or slur your words. You can still have a hot toddy if you want, curl up with a good book instead of that ridiculous rom-com. That's it. Relax and take it easy and ride the echinacea bus across town to health towers. Made by one woman with love and a love of herbs, not a big guy producing herbs en masse for the masses. This stuff is grown in a garden by someone who cares.
