Recycled Cotton  
ROMANIA

You know the expression when something is a confused mess it's like "a ball of twine"? I also use the expression "spaghetti pile-up" - picture a plate of spaghetti all knotted-up and intertwined. Okay, you're with me now. I want you to next think of Romanian politics, something I have been trying to understand for months. The current Romanian president was removed from office twice during his 10 years/2 terms and he was a member of the Communist party. There have only been 3 presidents in Romania's history since the Communist leader Ceaușescu was overthrown. So since 1989 - 25 years - there have been only 3 different people running the country. Two of them have clear ties to the Ceaușescu regime and both were suspended from office. The other, I have yet to figure out. The winner of the November 16th election was Klaus Iohannis. With currently more likes on Facebook than any other European leader, no history with the Communist party and a mission to fight corruption, he seems to be of a new guard. We hope so - Romania has so much potential. Come on Klaus - wrap it up! Here's a ball of twine! Start unraveling!
