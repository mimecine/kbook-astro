Tar-dipped Twine  
SWEDEN

Tar-dipped twine was traditionally used on boats as tar prevented the thread from rotting in the humid environment. Nowadays most sailors use nylon thread in its place, but many enthusiasts still stick with the strongly fragrant twine and one can find it in many sail shops throughout Sweden. Manufacturing tar twine is regarded as high-risk, since it's a manual process with highly flammable matters until theyâ€™re dry. Honestly, to really fasten something with twine, I would opt for the modern nylon version, but for pleasing my eyes and nose, nothing beats this thread. Oh, it has a great feel as well! The wood needle is for repairing fishing nets; it's not used with the twine but the combination was so striking we had to sell them as a group. Ah! Swedish summers...
