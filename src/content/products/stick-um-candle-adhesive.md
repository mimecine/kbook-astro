Wax, Unknown Scent & Secrets  
USA

I grew up in a small home from the 1930s filled with loads of early American furniture. Candles were a popular item in our house. It was cozy. Even today I have a stock of candlesticks left over from the '80s. I found them in the attic of our home four years ago when we moved out. Stick-Um was a staple, always located in the top-left drawer of the jam cupboard in the living room. I can't say we used it every time, but often enough, as it came in handy with vintage candle holders. I have owned one small can since the early '90s. First it was in my prop kit when I worked as a set designer. Then I took it with me to Sweden. Then I brought it back here to New York. I have to say, when Chris found the product as a suggestion for this collection, I was surprised it was still in production. I was even more surprised to find it in our "junk" drawer at home when I was spring cleaning. It's just one of those things you cannot do without, that trails you around wherever you go - like kids, if you have them.
