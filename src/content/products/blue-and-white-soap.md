2.5" x 15.5"  
Soap  
PORTUGAL

Marbleized soap like marble cake. Found in the bathroom at the Knights of Templar complex, Convent of the Order of Christ, in Tomar, a huge compound established in 1160 and subsequently added onto for 500 years. While other tourists were taking pictures of the UNESCO World Heritage site, I was photographing the soap in the bathroom in the most obscure way possible to avoid odd looks. The smell is reminiscent of American public schools. I like it, not everyone does, come in for a sniff. PS: If you go to Tomar, visit the complex and for sure see the Window of the Chapter House, which is generally considered to be the most impressive example of Manueline architecture; it is.
