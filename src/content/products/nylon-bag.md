26" x 17"Â before extension, 12" handle  
Nylon  
HONG KONG

A good bag particularly for soft goods. It expands more than our German net bag and can also fit over the shoulder, which is a plus. I bet babies and small pets would fit fine wrapped in blankets, but I am not sure that is the proper thing to do. This was an odd one as we saw it in only one store in all of our travels around Hong Kong. Funny, as they are so basic, practical, and great one would guess they would be everywhere, but nope...
