4.5"Ã¸ x 3.5", 8 oz.  
Black Tobacco, Fire Cured & Flavored with Vanilla  
USA

Black Cavendish\-style tobacco with a hint of caramel, chocolate and vanilla and a burly ply cut. Sounds yummy, no? I also heard: Virginia flake, smooth, mild, on the sweet side, and earthy. Blended since 1870 at the L.J. Peretti headquarters in Boston (one of the oldest tobacconists in the nation), it was voted one of the 10 best in the world by Forbes magazine. All that aside, we all know smoking is not cool, but if you are going to smoke a pipe, smoke it right. The minimal lettering and color scheme of the can may lead you to believe that this is a generic tobacco, but in fact it was made just for you. Personally blended by one person, this blend was checked by a second \- maybe the boss and the boss' boss? Whoever created this blend loves caramel.
