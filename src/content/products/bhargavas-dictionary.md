Paper  
INDIA

<!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} -->

While in India, I quickly realized I needed a guide, but not in the way I was used to. I wasn't looking for a local to explain things to me or an expat who could give me a rundown, although both of those did prove helpful every day. I needed something that did not talk, that would not block my hearing, that would alert and open my mind to everything around me in such a complete way it would overwhelm all of my standard impulses, all of my senses. I knew it had to come from the mind and from within. Where else would I find this than in a dictionary? Searching for an English word and reading the Indian definition gave me immediate insight into the way of the world on the sub-continent. Over "67,89,000" copies sold, this already tells one enough: look with your eyes and see the typo carefully, then consider. This is your beginning. "Correct, standard pronunciation and accents in Hindi."
