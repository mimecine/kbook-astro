15" x 6"  
Aluminum  
INDIA

I tested this hanger for one year and it passed. One year for a hanger, the lowest of low objects - I mean, it lives in a closet, hidden on most occasions - may seem excessive, however, in my world, it is not. And it's not necessarily about perfection or cost. Nor is it strictly dictated by aesthetics, although they do play into the decision. Rather, it is all about function. Some of you are nodding your heads now. How does the garment hang, do things fall off it, is it wide enough, does it get dirty easily? I want you to consider those splintery hangers, those plastic hangers with dirt marks, those Ikea hangers with sticker residue on them. Then, do me a favor, consider this hanger and consider why I tested it for a year. It functions, it works, it's pleasing, it's neutral, I can see and appreciate my clothes. I was surprised the owner of the stand where I bought these hangers remembered me after a year. But he sells hangers and it was clear, given his task in life, he was really glad to find someone who appreciated and cared for hangers as much as he. In all my travels, this is my favorite hanger and now my side of the closet is filled only with it.
