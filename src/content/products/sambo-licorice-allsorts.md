ICELAND

**I am pretty sure you are familiar with the British Allsorts invented by Bassetâ€™s. This is it, but made in Iceland. My guess is Kolus got the idea of Allsorts from the British troops that were stationed on Iceland during WWII. I was surprised that Iceland felt more influenced by America and Britain than Scandinavia, as it is considered a Nordic country. At the beginning of the 1900s, Iceland was a sovereign state of Denmark, and you can still feel a touch of Danish influence, but only a touch. The country peacefully declared independence from Denmark in 1941. During WWII, America and Britain occupied the country, and, later, an American military base had a noticeable presence until 2006. Since 2006, the Icelanders have been on their own. I think it is good.**
