I am very happy to be back at KIOSK with my 6th annual Christmas shop! I have a special guest this year, Oceola Bragg & David Kincaide who is one of the most favorite vendors at The Antique Garage Flea Market on 25th Street. They have being at the market for 17 years since it started in 1994. As they call themselves "In the collectible zone", they carry everything from junk to collectable items with real " flea market" prices.  They always teach me the joy of finding, appreciation of the objects and history & story behind them. So it is more like a Saturday school for me. I have been going to their market since I moved to NY and now became a good friend. I am very happy to be collaborating with them for my 6th annual Christmas Shop. We have many one-of-a kind special objects like ornament, snow dome, doll, ribbon, Christmas card, tinsel decoration and more. Please do come by our Christmas Shop!
