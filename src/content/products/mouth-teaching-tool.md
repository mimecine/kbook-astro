10" x 8"  
Painted Styrofoam  
MEXICO

AaaaaH! Now open wide. Before I went to Mexico for KIOSK, I was unaware Mexicans had such an amazing assortment of educational teaching tools and toys. They are really fantastic, and unlike those in the United States, everything is not branded like crazy. Wooden toys are popular, as are the Mexican teaching posters, and there are many fantastic model kits. However, I was really interested in the Styrofoam teaching toys. There was everything from a foam camera, a pink foam typewriter and a working volcano in foam. I'd love to speak with a teacher to find out which class uses this mouth! There is a chart on the back detailing the different teeth and other parts. A little bit strange, yet very creative...
