21.5" x 5"  
Iron  
ROMANIA

He was the entertainer. We were poking around his studio when he came back home. It was a grandiose display, it was amazing. A gigantic bellows fueling the fire and an equally bellowing, rumbling voice from out of this world. He put on a sales show and we were captivated. I practically handed him everything I had. The women of the house were, at the same time he was banging away in the forge, selling me felt objects I did not need and poking me, asking if I had children. All of this was happening in a language no one but their tribe could understand. Charming to say the least, and simultaneously worrying, mystifying and honest. The expression "beyond words" could have originated in such a moment. We watched, we ordered, we learned the Roma way of sales and I swore I would practice it at KIOSK. Just wait until the holiday season gets into high gear and we only have two of these left in stock.
