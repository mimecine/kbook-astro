Steel  
HONG KONG

Every day is a good day for egg tarts. These famed sweets are flakey pie crusts filled with egg custard that is baked to just about solid. It actually took us a few tries before we got accustomed to their rawer-than-what-we-are-used-to feeling, but once the stomach and the psyche got the hang of it, there was no end to the number of these we could eat. They should be served fresh and still pretty hot, so ideally one should make them at home if a Hong Kong bakery is not nearby. Yum yum yum! Of course the cups can also be used for fancier French things. Speaking of which, egg tarts originated in Macao via the Portuguese; some bakeries sell "Hong Kong Style" egg tarts and others sell "Portuguese Style." To me they taste pretty similar, all are good. The most famous bakery in Hong Kong for egg tarts is Tai Cheong Bakery in Lan Kwai Fong, where they are nicknamed "Fat Patten's Egg Tart" after the last British governor, Chris Patten; "Fat Patten" is his nickname in Cantonese. One last thing: to try legit egg tarts you do not necessarily have to go to Hong Kong, we found some pretty good ones in Chinatown, New York!
