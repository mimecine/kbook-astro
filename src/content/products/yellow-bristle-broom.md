54" x 10"  
Wood, Steel & Polypropylene Bristles  
USA

The Milwaukee Dustless Brush company was established in 1897. Their namesake is a broom that dispersed a fluid onto floor surfaces while sweeping. It was revolutionary and extremely popular at the time. Fast forward to the present...the Speed Corn Broom was designed to meet the needs of general purpose sweeping. It is made of long-lasting flagged and chemical resistant poly bristles melted together to form a solid sweeping surface. The bristles are protected by a steel casing riveted to the broom and the handle. An interesting detail about polypropylene is if it loses its shape, it can be soaked in boiling water, hung to dry and will snap back into its original position. Call this broom the "Terminator 2"! When they sent me an image of a housekeeper holding her 20-year-old broom worn to a stub and her identical replacement, I really understood how the broom takes a beating.
