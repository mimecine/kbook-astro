Popcorn, Sugar, Corn Syrup, Butter, Vegetable Shortening, Water & Salt  
USA

Air-popped and hand-churned since 1940 on the Boardwalk in Ocean City, it's a butter and caramel explosion all in one, and a very momentous moment in time. It's hard to stop. I'll never forget a line I was told in 1995: it was just after graduating university, and I was broke. My girlfriend and I really wanted a Schraft's mint ice cream bar but we could only afford one between the two of us. When handing over the ice cream the man delicately, almost mystically, said to us, "One is not enough." I'll never forget that moment. Why? Because he was right. One was not enough; it was delicious, but one was all we could afford. Why do I write this story here? Because like the Schraft's mint sandwich, one handful of this popcorn is not enough; in fact, one tub of this popcorn might not be enough. Take my word for it and heed those mystical words.
