Terracotta  
PORTUGAL

The weekly market in Barcelos, just north of Porto, is the largest in Portugal. It's not particularly huge but it is very interesting. At the end of the day, we met the woman selling this bank, as well as other terracotta articles. She is quite old and told us she was selling them for her husband. I really wanted to help her out, I knew we would select something from her. After a bit more discussion, we learned her husband and his brother make the pieces together; this is all they have ever done. I found it sad to think to get the coins out one needs to smash the bank, but then Marco pointed out coins can always be shaken out. This is true. I agree. I love Marco. The bank has a beautiful shape and touch to it.
