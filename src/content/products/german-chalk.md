Chalk  
GERMANY

Chalk was first used in cave paintings. A natural, mineral composition, in the 1800s, it was employed in classrooms on chalkboards as a way to present information to larger groups (a result of expanding classes). Our chalk has a handy sleeve that is easily adjusted - a practical feature, otherwise, paper always gets in the way. Ever use chalk on the sidewalk for hopscotch? Hopscotch originated in Britain during the Roman Empire as foot training for soldiers. Children created the game to copy the soldiers' movements. In this respect, buying a box of chalk could provide a cheap alternative to the gym. The chalk + the sidewalk + you = good workout!
