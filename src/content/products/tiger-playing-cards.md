2.5" x 3.5"  
Coated Paper  
HONG KONG

These cards are here not for their high quality, but for their looks and the fab fortunes they will bring you! Hong Kong is very much a place for games; Tiger Cards were sold in many places, along with mahjong sets. We had a mahjong club above us where we stayed in Wan Chai, and we loved falling asleep to the fast-paced clickety-clicks the game broadcasted into our room - even though it took us a few nights to figure it out.
