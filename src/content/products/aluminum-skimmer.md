Aluminum  
COLOMBIA

What do you have to skim? Frankly, I don't have much. I do boil milk in the morning, but I would never skim off that yummy cream. Although, I am certain if I switched to low-fat, or no-fat, dairy, I would loose a few. Skimming money from the account at KIOSK? Why bother?! I'd only be stealing from myself. Hmmm, okay, how about removing things from liquid? Like olives! But when would I have that big a barrel of olives? Wait a minute, my friend Chris told me that when he was in Colombia, he used a skimmer to pull all sorts of things out of hot water, such as beets, eggs, or potatoes. Now we are talking - I have a real use for this thing. According to Chris, this skimmer is most commonly used to cook a snack called bu√±uelos: a deep fried corn flour ball about the size of a golf ball (or a munchkin) with cheese in the middle. You'll find them on every other street corner.
