Terracotta  
COLOMBIA

Jorge Preto is an anthropologist, who specializes in pre-Columbian ceramics, and a ceramicist. A professor at the university of Antioquia, Jorge invites his students to his house in the forest to work with terracotta the same way pre-Colombian cultures did. The clay the mugs are made of comes from extruded terracotta bricks, the type of bricks found all over the city. He picks them up from a factory, unfired, and reconstitutes the terracotta. These mugs get better with age, as the clay becomes cured with use. Chris spent some time working with Jorge in Colombia. I hope to meet Jorge when I make it down to Colombia. Every cup is numbered, and each comes in a box filled with pine needles from the forest behind Jorge's house.
