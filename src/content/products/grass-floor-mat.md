Straw  
COLOMBIA

My friend Chris was able to procure two of these mats when he was in Colombia. In fact, he got the last two that were available in the market. They are from the southern part of the country which is largely indigenous peoples and the maker is unknown. Indigenous Amerindians make up only 1% of the Colombian population but there are 80 different languages spoken in Colombia and the indigenous reserves make up a total of 30% of the country. When I go to Colombia I plan on visiting the south. This type of weaving reminds me of an Indonesian floor mat I used to own, which in turn reminds me of a mat I saw last year in a market in Tamil Nadu. The patterns are surprisingly similar. Longer, this mat would make a perfect beach mat - short, as it is, makes it good for next to the bed or as a mat to sit on in your reading corner. I took my own advice and I have it set up in the corner with a reading lamp, a bunch of pillows and the aluminum tea tray, which, as it has feet, acts as a very small, low table.
