You may believe you don't need these little boxes; I believed the same for years. It was only after I decided to add a little decadence to my life did I come to appreciate these containers. Generally speaking, I travel with them--although I do have a large one specifically for my bangles (and they live in it whether I am traveling or at home). I also use them to store my electrica and a variety of herbal remedies and needs. The small is great for earplugs and the large for ear-buds. They make me feel a little bit classy whenever I take them out. I relish their presence in the back of the economy class, seated directly behind the engine or strait over the wing, my standard seating assignment. The black and white pattern has a distinctively 80s art deco feel. I think of Andrée Putman every time I use them, and she was a very classy lady who I so admire.
