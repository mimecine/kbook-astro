.25" x 4.5", 50 sticks in a package  
Wood  
HONG KONG

A mix of Meccano and ice cream sticks, these are the type of toys that awaken the engineer in you. In a way, better than Lego, thanks to their ability to collapse more easily - the laws of nature are more exposed with sticks than with pieces of plastic that click together! Ok, I like Lego too, lots, but this is more realistic. Trial and error really comes into play. If you lose a stick, it’s a great excuse to get an ice cream bar and carve yourself a replacement stick! I’d rather do that than most other things in this life. Ice cream, carving, and building towers. Ahhh!
