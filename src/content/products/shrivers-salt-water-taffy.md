Salt Water Taffy was certainly invented in Victorian times. Pages from the society journal read as follows: I realized I needed a box one afternoon at the height of summer while I was lounging on my pale-pink divan in my new Boudicca dress, fabulous. Life is so fabulous, listening to Chopin with some friends, and not quite delicately enough, eating chocolate-covered cherries one by one. What to do with the drips down the chin? Devastating! How to carefully nibble around them rather than eating whole? My lipstick? Crisis! Christ help me! My guests were mortified, as was I, you might well imagine. The next day, I sent Francis out to find a solution. He came back with the only option, Shriver's Taffy (founded in 1898!) and in an oh-so-lovely decorated box. The green pattern matches my throw pillows, and with so many colors inside, there is one to coordinate with everyone's outfit! Even purple! Now we eat salt water taffy. Cherries are such a thing of the past. Oh, yawn, life is such a bother.
