9 yds.  
Plastic  
MEXICO

Don't we all need a good piece of rope? Found at the market in Toluca, the little boy selling these was so excited when we bought up his stock, it meant he could go home early for the day. The rope is commonly used for a laundry line and usually can be found in white, blue, or yellow; we never saw it again in this coloring. It is strange, as it appears to have been dyed to look very natural, like hemp, but a Mexican friend pointed out nothing of the sort is done deliberately to utilitarian objects so it must have been a mistake in the dyeing process. Will we ever know?
