14" x 22"  
Letterpress Ink on Paper  
USA

Produced by REFERENCE LIBRARY for Mini-Exhibition #8. It sums up a lot of life. This is the fourth printing; I guess it sums things up again and again. Comes in solid fluorescent yellow and solid fluorescent pink, too. "In the first few days of REFERENCE LIBRARY, Greg Allen described the Items I Didn't Win posts as being 'depressingly awesome.' I couldn't have said it better myself. The poster is printed with hand-set wood type by The Colby Poster Printing Company, family owned and operated since 1946. The Brothers Hinman were super nice. Thanks, dudes!" - Andy Beach
