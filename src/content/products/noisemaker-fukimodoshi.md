JAPAN

<!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} -->

Have you ever been on a Japanese highway?  
With that in mind, have you ever stopped at a Japanese highway pull-off?  
It's got everything,  
although some things are of dubious quality and nature,  
and often one does find complimentary green tea.  
We found this noisemaker -  
the driver was frazzled by our infrequent blowings,  
but since we could not understand anyone  
and they could not understand us  
and we were not even sure where we were going,  
we decided to behave poorly  
and toot our horn.  
Can you believe 80% of Japanese-made noisemakers are from Awaji Island  
and this one comes from a place called "Noisemaker Village"?
