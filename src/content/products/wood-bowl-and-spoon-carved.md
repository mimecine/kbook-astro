spoon: 10" long, bowl: 5.5"Ã¸  
Wood  
ROMANIA

Many people have asked me exactly what I would use this set for. Perfect for warm porridge in the winter, Mother Goose? Baby's first plate? Jam on the table with waffles on the side too? You name it. My point is they don't have to be used together. The carving is simply so pretty on each I felt they should stick together. But we don't like rules around this place, so do as you will! We'll never know and you don't have to tell us. Decorated with a traditional Romanian motif by a family in the Banat region of Romania.
