Paper  
USA

WHY?... "I made it to document all the rumors about the building that have been floating around since I was a kid. I think people forget that city kids also create architectural folklore and that it isn't limited to suburban kids with haunted houses. In doing so I hope to have even extended its folklore a little bit. It was also nice to have all these written accounts of a child's relationship with a building, which especially in this case, is really just a massive object. It was also just fun to see how many different "meanings" this building has accumulated just on the basis of speculation and hearsay, how this effort towards demystification in fact just mystifies the building more. I made it by sending out a mass text to all the kids I grew up with in TriBeCa, Soho and Battery Park City. Just asking them for any rumors they have heard or might've even created (I also included two rumors that I heard or made up). Then I walked around it one day and took pictures. A couple days later I compiled the texts I received and paired them with the photos. Waited till night and and walked over to a photocopier at NYU where I know I can photocopy for free, and that's it. It was done." - LB.
