Fudge!  
USA

Fudge, the great American summertime icon - right up there with salt-water taffy. Murdick's hails from Mackinac Island where it originated in 1887. The story goes that Mr. Murdick was a fisherman on the Great Lakes and between May and September, if the weather forecast in the Farmers' Almanac was good, he would come in and open up his fudge stand; if the weather forecast was bad, he would stay out fishing on the Lake. In the 1970s, Bob Benser - who first worked for the Murdick family at what was then a small operation, and later bought the business from them - was approached by a friend to open up a fudge shop on the Vineyard. Since then, they have been producing fudge as well as peanut brittle. It was hard to choose a flavor, but never mind, all are good!
