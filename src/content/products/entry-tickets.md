Paper  
FINLAND

<!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} -->

I was drawn to the tickets because the font is very particular and the paper has a nice quality. The manufacturer is a typical Finnish company, they produce a myriad of things, from plastic parts to entry tickets to metal gadgets - they design, manufacture, subcontract and distribute. The entry tickets are one of their “oldest” items, in production since 1985. The graphic looked more dated to me but, yet, undefined at the same time. For a couple of days we were debating on whether to include the tickets in the collection. Then we visited the house in Ruovesi of Akseli Gallen-Kallela, one of Finland’s most important National Romantic painters, a magical place, and were given one-half of these tickets upon entry. We then knew this is a unique object as his great-granddaughter who minds the house has one of the most discerning eyes I have ever encountered. Good enough for her, good enough for me, good enough for you!
