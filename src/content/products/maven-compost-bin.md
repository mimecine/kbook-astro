Eastern White Cedar & Galvanized Steel Hardware  
USA

Holly began making backyard compost bins soon after running the largest compost facility in Vermont. She knows her stuff. Maven bins are animal proof, and as she says in the voice of an expert, "Just put anything that is organic in there and you are golden." Or you have "black gold," as some people like to call their compost. The bin is made of sustainably harvested white cedar, which is naturally rot resistant. And given that it is open to the elements, there is no need to water your pile; nature takes care of that for you. If you have the space, it's best to have two bins: one that is active, and one that is dormant, supplying the stock. Last note: there is a magical side door that makes it easy to scoop stuff out (the top door is for dropping in leftovers). Compost! Feed your garden, save money, and know you produce less waste!
