INDIA

<!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} -->

The Hercules bell could just as well be called Hanuman, both being known for their strength. Which is what the bell is: both physically and aurally… strong. It is also large in size. In India, the sound I most often heard was the rickshaw or scooter horn, but there was occasionally a bicycle bell in the distance. It's very loud in order to compete with the rickshaw roaches. Often I think to myself, which sense helps me recall a place most easily? Is it the sound, the smell, or the sight of the place? What about taste and touch?
