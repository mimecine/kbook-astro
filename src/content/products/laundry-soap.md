Laundry Soap, Rosemary &Â Citrus Scented.  
THE NETHERLANDS

Traveling with a bar of laundry soap through India proved to be one of the best decisions of my life. Even so, it's very possible this item could be one of those items that will completely tank at KIOSK. It could be a primo example of where we got in too deep with a very unsexy product. It's completely practical and there is nothing glamorous, luxury-oriented or chic about this soap. However, it smells good and, on a practical level, it is a great item. How many times have you been traveling and not wanted to buy a huge laundry detergent? How about a laundry soap bar you use at night and is dry and ready to pack in the morning? Lightweight too. Suspend your snobbery about De Traay. You're too cool to worry about feeling nerdy buying laundry soap. Marco thought it was outrageous for KIOSK to sell such a thing! Way off target. I don't think we have those types of parameters at KIOSK. It's simple - what works is here and good is good. Best used with the soap cage from this collection.
