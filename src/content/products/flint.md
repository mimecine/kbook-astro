THE NETHERLANDS

I am sorry, but my Flint is not for sale. How do you explain when something as simple as a bottle refused to leave your memory, and all the things associated with finding the bottle refuse to leave it, too? Even if it is not that special to most, something in your primitive mind latches onto that thing, and does not let it go. Is it the bottle that makes you recall a bottle in the garage of your childhood home? Or, does it relate to a cleaning fluid you used to use in a past career? Do you even know or understand the association? How much is it about the moment alone? Does your brain suddenly construct a hundred associations around the thing? Are they valid associations, or simply the coincidences of your senses becoming invested in one object? That is Flint. I am sorry, but the bottle has changed, so we cannot offer it to you. It is metal polish.
