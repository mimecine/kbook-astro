This thing is the Cadillac of hammocks, or the Maybach, or whatever is your measure of luxury. I don't know why cars get to be the ultimate measure of luxury, but I'm not setting the rules here, just delivering the truth. One of the things that gives hammocks a bad rap is how far you sink into them.Your back just becomes a big banana. Not so with this baby - the lovely wood frame takes care of that. Sink just so far into it and take a nap in a few minutes, or finish that wonderfully crappy novel - this is like a relaxation machine, backyard or beachside magic. Produced the same way as always by a husband-and-wife team trained in optical engineering. They started making them because, in 1982, they saw potential in hammocks and people asked them for a chair. Hence the hammock chair was born for you to swing in and do your thing. With footrest or without, but we really suggest with! _Please note, due to staffing shortages at the maker, they are currently delivering 10 weeks from the order date. The good news is, once you have this and if you care for it it will last an indefinite period of time. It's worth the wait!_
