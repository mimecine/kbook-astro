Broom: 14" x 1.5" x 3"  
Handmade of Wood & Horsehair  
Dustpan:10" x 10.5" x 4"  
Powder Coated Steel  
SWEDEN

Have you bought a broom and dustpan recently? Can't find anything that is not plastic and that works properly? This set takes you back to the 40s, but works better than the 2000s. The broom is handmade by the Iris Group, a foundation founded in the late 1800s, that employs the visually impaired. The dustpan is produced by a small factory called Nyby in Gnosjö, a town known in Sweden for its entrepreneurial spirit, or as the saying goes...Gnosjö-andan! A bunch of our Swedish suppliers are from there and they all seem to communicate/share resources with each other. Good, solid scene.
