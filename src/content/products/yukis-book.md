7.5" x 5"  
Paper  
JAPAN, but written in the USA

A guide to cheap eats in New York by Yuki Matsuo. Let me say a few things about this book: 1. It always sits to the left of my desk within arm's reach. 2. It has been stolen three times. 3. It is a brilliant, indispensable guide to places to eat in New York City. 4. It features only inexpensive restaurants from three of the boroughs, great if you are on a budget, i.e.: starting your own business. 5. In Japanese, but the pictures say it all and the contact information is in English! October 2010: A great guide and now the first printing is sold out, so what we have is all we will ever have! Rumor has it she is eating like mad and working on a second version! December 2010: Sorry! All copies are gone! Try Project Number 8, they might still have some! Update!: Yuki has made an iPhone app version — in English — of her book.
