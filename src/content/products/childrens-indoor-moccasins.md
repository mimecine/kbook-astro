Sizes 6 months - 2 years  
Wool & Polyester with a Suede Sole  
SWEDEN

When asking Swedes about their memories of these, most peoples’ faces light up. Yes, they were a bit dumpy; yes, they still are; but their being a soft, robust mix between a sock and a slipper that still had a good grip for running around the house - this, our Swedes felt, was their play-date saver. Yes, today’s parents have - “of course!” - gotten their kids a pair. The indoor moccasin of Sweden was conceived in the early seventies and has all the goofy characteristics of that time.
