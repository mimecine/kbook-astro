Parents, please note: these are not cigarettes, they are candy sticks! Just because when you were young, they were cigarettes, does not mean they are still cigarettes. Life has changed and so has youth. Teenagers don't smoke anymore, do they? Also, even though the "sticks" have a red tip like a cigarette and are called "Lucky Lights," that does not mean they are cigarettes. Nope, they are candy sticks, not candy cigarettes. That means you can do all sorts of things with them: play the drums, mark things in the garden, stir your coffee or soda - but you cannot pretend to smoke them because they are not candy cigarettes, they are candy sticks, ok? You got that?
