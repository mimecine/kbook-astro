Loofah  
MEXICO

Scratch Scratch me back. Scratch Scratch me back. It really is a fact, the less I itch the more I scratch. All right, now, you could run down to Rite-Aid or the BIG K or any of those handy shops and buy something that will essentially do the same as this loofah. But will it be as basic and pure and natural? And will it have a hole in the middle for hanging it? And the essential question here: was it bought directly from the maker and dragged back by hand from a market in downtown Mexico City by two nice kids from New York, or was it shipped by the 1,000s in a container from some sweatshop in some unknown land? I’ll let you decide which seems more interesting. Roll with it….
