2.25" x 2"  
Glass & Paint  
HONG KONG

I recently decided that each trip needs (deserves?) a good souvenir. We were walking through the famous (-ly tacky) Temple Street Market one evening and across from the various sex toys and a woman explaining how to use certain ones to a very old gentleman in a very loud voice in Cantonese (we luckily had our translator friend with us that day) I came across a nice but hustling huckster. Sure, I had heard about the snuff bottles in the market before but he was, in a way, more sincere. Why? Because he was so certain what he was selling was good, valid, precious, important to me, and valuable, or maybe, thinking about it, was he was not so certain but just a brilliant salesman? Regardless, with this certainty and the amount of dignity he possessed I had to support him and decided... a hand-painted snuff bottle with Hong Kong scenery on it, could there be a better souvenir? Very nostalgic.
