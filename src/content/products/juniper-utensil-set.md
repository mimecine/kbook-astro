Knife: 7" Fork: 8" Spoon: 6"  
Juniper  
SWEDEN

Approximately around the age of 7, in the first year of school, every Swedish child takes woodworking class. And, in this class, children make a butter knife. Though none of the store-bought ones can ever be as nice, since they are not made by small children's hands, this butter knife, herring fork and traditional sugar spoon are nearly just as pleasing. They are also handmade, although by adults. The maker / owner is a true entrepreneur. After being in the tobacco and pet product business for 35 years, he looked around and was struck with the desire to produce kitchen utensils in juniper. Using juniper to make kitchen tools dates from 1600. The juniper bush grows very slowly so the wood is between 40-80 years old and difficult to obtain. However, for him, the most complicated aspect was assembling his team of makers. It took more than a year to gather the men willing to do it, but over time, he built up a small manufacturing pool with most producers working from home, making the utensils bit by bit and one by one. The wood is solid and smells quite nice. They will last at least a decade if you care for them well.
