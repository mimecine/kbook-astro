6" x 4"  
Melamine  
PORTUGAL

At KIOSK we have a knack for creating a network of locals to direct, guide, and tip us off to all sorts of things. The Portuguese people were very helpful. It is likely because they sincerely care about their country and want it to do well. Do you know how exciting that is to be around? It's magnetic. Rosa Pomar tipped us off to the red sugar bowl. Thanks, Rosa!! It was first produced sometime between 1955 and 1964 and is made by one of the last melamine producers in Europe. I love the fins and the cherry-red color. Dipping my spoon in, in the morning, it says, "Hello, wake up!" in the most friendly way possible. It is the Portuguese equivalent of the American fluted glass sugar container, with the metal lid, that used to be found in every respectable American diner. The red sugar containers used to be everywhere in Portugal. They're becoming harder and harder to find.
