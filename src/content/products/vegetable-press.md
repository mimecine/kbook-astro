9"ø x 15" x 5"  
Steel  
FRANCE

1993: masher from my grandmother, wooden handle, 1940s vintage, decent effect. 1998: thanks to Williams Sonoma, a better hand-masher is located. 2001: potato press discovered in Stockholm, Sweden, new husband swears by it, never felt it delivered but felt obligated to use it as was building new familial relationships. 2009: trip to India brought a new mallet type stick, used for pounding, stirring, pressing, mashing, all good things in the Indian kitchen, deeply versatile, good to travel with and yet the rough wood always left me wondering. 2020: after admiring on summer holidays to the family home for close to 15 years, the Covid confinement in France brought a new emphasis on the kitchen and kitchen gadgets that in turn pressured me to seek out the vegetable press I was most satisfied with. Produced by Guillouard for generations, I took an unusual path and decided to go for the "premium" model as I like the feel of the wood in my hand rather than plastic. Guaranteed for 10 years, this model also comes with 3 screens for making everything from fruit coulis to soup to purees. The search is over, no more mashing or pounding but rather a turning device has been found, the solution!
