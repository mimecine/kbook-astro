Sugar & Peppermint Oil  
SWEDEN

This is actually not just a candy, it is a _Polkagris_, which translates to “polka pig.” Ask any Swede what this is, and they will definitely either think you are a total weirdo, or their eyes will mist over with longing for the days of their youth. Unbelievably, there is only one town in all of Sweden that is known for the _Polkagris_, Gränna; also unbelievably, 9 out of 10 Swedes say they have passed through there while on summer holidays when they were a child, and were given a stick. Think of it as a pacifier with a hearty dose of sugar - kind of a contradiction, but parents swear by them.
