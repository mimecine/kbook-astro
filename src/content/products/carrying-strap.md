80" length  
100% Woven Plastic  
MEXICO

Want to make yourself look cool and sexy while carrying a box? Then you better get this carrying strap, what a fashion accessory! Comes with a picture of it in use, live from the streets of San Cristobal, Chiapas! More seriously, it is a great icon of interesting utilitarian design, so even if you don't carry your own boxes you'll want to have this for your collection. The man who sold us a bunch of these thought it was really funny we needed so many! We tried to explain... Generally this type of strap is used to carry firewood and the band rests on the forehead. I honestly do not think it is particularly common to use it to carry boxes, just heavy loads from the fields or forests.
