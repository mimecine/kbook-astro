Cotton  
USA

So, right around now you may be wondering why this t-shirt is called "Cosmic" t-shirt - and you have every right to ask. "Cosmic" stands for "Cosmic Cotton," the excellent maker of our shirts. Gary, the owner, is located up in Waitsfield and is a perennial at the farmers market there, which is where we met him. We are having a hard time reaching Gary, so order a shirt now if it's in stock. Gary toured with the Dead and we had a really nice talk. I found out he was from the same area I was from in New Jersey. He is a great guy and I feel very lucky to have met him. He is an excellent tie-dyer to boot. Thanks, Gary, wherever you are, and call us when you get a chance, we need you!
