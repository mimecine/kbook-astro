Paper & Ink  
FRANCE 

Who knows how this was printed, but I do know I like it - a lot. The Vasarely Foundation, opened in 1976, is located just outside of Aix and is literally a massive work in itself. The structure and all of the work inside were created by Victor Vasarely, a Hungarian considered by many to be the founder of the Op-Art movement. Here are some notes from my visit: Vasarely wanted to create a "polychromatic city of happiness"; each room in the museum is called an "alveolus" after the hollow cavities found in lungs. I have one note in the center of the page all alone that says "Planetary Folklore." The Foundation is trapped in time, like this poster. It's a gem of gigantic proportions, too. An optical beauty and a transitory illusion at best. We suggest the next time you go to Provence you get away from all the clichés and leave your Blue Guides at home. Go contemporary and go Vasarely. He and his foundation are truly out of this world and waiting to lift off. You have to love that logo. Printed in 1976.
