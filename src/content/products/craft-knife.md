6" x .5"  
Nylon & Surgical Quality Blade  
ENGLAND

When I wrote “surgical quality blade” just now, I thought to myself, “NO JOKE!”. When I was photographing the knife, it was so sharp that not only did it cut me, but ten minutes passed before I realized that it had cut me. This is the perfect craft knife for sitting out in nature and making silhouettes of rocks or trees or mountains - whatever the heart desires. When I saw this knife, I thought, “I’m going to make a mountain and a donkey and a cart and a little troll, too, and the troll is going to be loading pumpkins into the donkey cart, everyone loves nature”. Please note the knife is very sharp as it has a surgical blade, and in the same respect, it is disposable; surgical blades are not used twice! But unless you are cutting some very serious stuff it does last for some time.
