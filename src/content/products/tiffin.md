Stainless Steel  
INDIA

A tasty treat in my tiffin, a tasty tiffin indeed. In Southern India I ate like a queen: Pure Veg, Pure Veg, Pure Veg! Never before was being a vegetarian a positive. Taste comes in many forms in India, and it is largely agreed the best-tasting food comes from inside the home. "Tiffin" means a light meal or, most commonly, lunch. Tiffin are the Indian lunchbox with, in this case, three parts to hold from bottom to top: veg, rice, and chapati, and two plates for eating on. I could often be found around town peering over people's shoulders, looking into their tiffin boxes. "Taste makes waste" I would tell them. Only one man corrected me with the word "haste"; but yes, I told him, "Taste is a tiffin."
