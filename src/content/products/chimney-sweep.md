SWEDEN

"What is it?" Every person who asks this is asked the same question back. Everyone thinks it is the perfect lampshade, and it probably is. What famous characters went down the chimney, besides Santa? Oliver Twist and Bert from Mary Poppins. In the early 1900's a typical way to "employ" young orphaned boys was to give them to chimney sweeps. Unlike Dick Van Dyke's genial, singing sweep in Mary Poppins, chimney sweeps were in reality pretty nasty. They used small boys-as young as four or five-as "climbing boys," and forced them to crawl into small, 12-by-14-inch chimneys to dislodge the five bushels of coal soot deposited there each year. Since sometimes the boys would get stuck, sweeps took to lighting fires under them, to "encourage" them to get themselves out. I bet the boys wished they had one of these!
