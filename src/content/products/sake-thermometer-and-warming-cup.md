Aluminum & Glass  
JAPAN

<!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} -->

Since 1947, Akao  
has been producing aluminum objects.  
In Japan, sake is enjoyed at different temperatures -  
Chilled, room temperature and heated.  
But as things go in Japan  
there are numerous temperatures and variations.  
For hot sake, atsukan, it is best at around 122 F.  
This is the red mark on the thermometer.  
The mark below is jyokan,  
and below that is nurukan,  
also hot sake temperatures, but less common.  
One uses this cup  
and the sake thermometer together  
to heat the sake.  
The cup gets placed in water  
in a pot on the stove.  
I never knew how to heat sake at home.  
We were in a very small izakaya  
the first night in Tokyo  
and I saw the host using this cup.  
So, we tracked it down for me and for you.
