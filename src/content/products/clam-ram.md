9.5" x 1"  
Stainless Steel  
USA

My father tipped us off to the Clam Ram. Marco headed straight for the computer to search for it, but instead of typing "Clam Ram," he typed "Ram Clam." Needless to say, a bunch of interesting links showed up...in front of the whole family. That was a real miscommunication moment! Nevertheless, this is a most innocent and practical object. Invented in Connecticut in the 60s, the current owner bought the business around 1980 and has not changed a thing. As a result, every part originates in Connecticut and the object is largely hand assembled. The packaging and printed matter hail from earlier days - very Kennedy. During the past 30 years, the company has only received two complaints. The Ram is so well made it comes with a lifetime warranty. It's a unique device for a unique person: someone picky, someone who has everything, someone who loves clams, that type.
