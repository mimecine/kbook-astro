Bamboo  
HONG KONG

Visit the wet markets of Hong Kong and you can find these trays overflowing with anything from vegetables to fish. The wet markets are fantastic examples of local society and are quickly disappearing. In a culture that prefers development and westernization to tradition and history, it comes as no surprise that the HK Urban Renewal Authority has plans to greatly modify two of the only large outdoor wet markets left on Hong Kong Island: the one in Central and the one in Wan Chai. Residents protest but their claims go largely unheard, all for the sake of "progress. If you visit Hong Kong I would suggest setting aside some time to experience these areas of local commerce before they are gone and replaced with climate-controlled malls and new constructions in the style of the old. Haven't the planners in Hong Kong learned from Disney's mistake at Celebration?
