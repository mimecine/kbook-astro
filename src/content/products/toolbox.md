Who really wants a big plastic toolbox in the house? Okay, raise your hand. If you did not raise your hand, please continue reading. A toolbox that's not meant for carrying around on the job, but that's very, very, handy to have at home in the closet. Not too big and not too small. No compartments. Just a solid open box that's waiting to hold all your basics in one place. When I worked as a set designer, we all had our "kits." This included the tools and supplies we needed on the job. I started out with a huge kit (by my standards): a big plastic toolbox (so ugly) and a big storage bin filled with other goodies. I mean large - but it could be transported in a taxi. Other people, generally men, needed vans to hold their kits. Hmmmm, similar to owning a flashy sports car, I think. Time went by, and I started going on planes to get to jobs. My kit shrunk down quite quickly into a camera person's bag - a round, soft tub-thing with many compartments. Over time, I realized what tools one could do without. When you get down to it, I think you need five different tools for home repair and then some screws, hooks and whatnot. This toolbox is a nod to handypersons in-the-know (though it comes in a very flashy 1980s automobile blue). I wonder why? Did I come back around to the sports car complex yet again?
