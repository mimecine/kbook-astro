Glazed Ceramic  
PORTUGAL

The Fábrica de Faianças Artísticas Bordalo Pinheiro was founded in 1884 by the illustrator and caricaturist Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro. Located in Caldas da Rainha, a town once filled with ceramic producers, where ceramics have been produced since Neolithic times, the factory was - until Bordalo Pinheiro's death in 1905 - the location of a creative industrial enterprise, similar to Arts and Crafts workshops in England and the US. When the original factory went bankrupt, Manuel Gustavo Bordalo Pinheiro purchased his father's molds and drawings at a public auction. The molds are now used by the current enterprise, founded in 1922. Every item is hand-finished and painted; the amount of labor that goes into each piece is impressive. It is easy to understand how the factory struggles financially with so much work going into every object.
