Cotton  
USA

It's not that I cared where they showered, but I was curious. I was a mix of hippie meets practical. I wanted to be relaxed but I was still loaded with suburban neuroses, much of which I have still not let loose. I remember the show went on and I did not want it to end. I remember doing a real get-down to "Sugar Magnolia" and it remains my favorite Dead song. There is something about the Dead, there may be people who really don't like the movement but do many people dislike the music? Let me know. Tie-dyes will forever be connected to the Dead and the hippie movement. I like it, I feel the vibration; one customer told me it was giving him an acid flashback when he saw it. I liked that and I asked him if he liked the feeling and he said "Yeah, it's good." If I could, I would wear tie-dyes most days. Story continued on the next t-shirt....
