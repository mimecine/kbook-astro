6"  
Maple  
JAPAN

Sometimes you come across something so unbelievably well done that you doubt it's real. You just have to pick it up, turn it over and over while running your fingers over the edges and surfaces in disbelief and awe. "I could do that" - no, not really, I couldn't. This is a tea-spoon, as in dry tea, not your cup of Twining's Earl Gray. Show it the respect it deserves and only let it touch some really good teas. Handmade by a master of Ittobori a very traditional wood working technique. A modern object produced by the owners of Higashiya in Tokyo in conjunction with the craftsman. Higashiya is one of the best Japanese sweet shops in Tokyo; we suggest you go. We are very pleased to offer their things this Christmas.
