Electrons, Bits, Pixels, Hunger  
JAPAN/USA/SWEDEN

Yuki released an app for your iPhone together with our Swedish friends at Ocean Observations. It came out of the book she made in 2007 that we had here at Kiosk, read about it [HERE.](http://kioskkiosk.com/products/yukis-book) Now you can carry all eating suggestions with you on your iThing if you have an iThing which we know a lot of you do. And, this time you don't have to decipher Japanese to know just how great of a meal you are about to have. There is no way we could be without Yuki and her food suggestions in New York. The New York City stomach has suddenly become carefree. Get this app in [iTunes Store, click HERE and do the dance](http://itunes.apple.com/app/yuki-eats-new-york/id440682721?mt=8)!
