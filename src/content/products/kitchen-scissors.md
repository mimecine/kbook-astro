8" x 3"  
Stainless Steel  
GERMANY

Made by a 275-year-old firm known for their high quality knives. These scissors are a multi-purpose shear, useful for cutting, as well as for bottle and lid opening, and even for difficult twist-offs. Their special blend of chromium and carbon makes these one of the best stainless steels on the European market. My mother had a pair, which I now own - she kept them close, within hand's reach in her kitchen drawer. I have mine hanging from a hook over the kitchen sink. Twist, turn, clip, crank anything. It's good to have a separate pair for your cooking needs.
