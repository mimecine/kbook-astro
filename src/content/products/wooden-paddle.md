11" x 4.5"  
Spruce & Linseed Oil  
ICELAND

In Iceland I saw water running backwards and I drove through a sandstorm. I hiked on a glacier and ran through deep moss that made me bounce. I came across a hot pool in the middle of nowhere and jumped in, and I climbed a dormant volcano. I crawled to the edge. I stared at trapped icebergs and touched a pounding waterfall. I waited for a volcano to erupt and I was scared to death, at night, in a house with Jason, in the middle of some nowhere, more remote than I have ever been. I drove where no man or woman should probably ever go. I went to "The Volcano Show." I hiked up a mountain and crawled over sharp rock the last feet through fog, to touch the top, just because, because. Magical place and space. An anthroposophical community called SÃ³lheimar is in the middle of it all, working with people with needs, to make things like these paddles. I can't explain it. I look at them, and I recall all of those things I just told you, and more, in such a quick succession it makes me hold my blink. Thank you for going there.
