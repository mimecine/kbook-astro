The Texan "York" sheller has a long history. Invented by R.D. "Shorty" York, owner of York Body and Fender Works, in the early 1940s - Shorty got the idea after watching a squirrel peel a pecan. Patented in 1945, it has been sold since 1953 to thousands of nuts everywhere. You might guess he based the sheller on a pair of pliers he had in his shop. The way it works is unlike a standard nutcracker - you use it to cut off each end and the sides of the nut, leaving the inside perfectly whole, rather than producing cracked-up pieces. The shield on the side was a later addition Shorty's wife requested when she grew tired of picking up his shells from the living room rug. If you remove the shield the sheller works great as a lobster or crab cracker. The sheller is sharp; it makes nut shelling really easy. Good for all kinds of nuts including: pecans, Brazil nuts, walnuts and almonds.
