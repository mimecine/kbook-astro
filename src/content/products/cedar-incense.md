2.5" x 4" x 1.5"  
Pressed Cedar  
USA

Basically, I'm sensitive. You might have guessed by now, and with this certain level of sensitivity (pickiness) comes a certain attention (neurosis) to certain things (scent, sound, taste, aesthetics, everything). Smell is high on my list. With this certain sensitivity I channel all sorts of good things (like what we have at Kiosk), and all sorts of bad things (cat pee, mildew, mold, sitting water, overcooked peanut butter cookies, etc.) straight into the brain. Odor is fortunately easy to adjust. I learned a long, long time ago that it's easy to change a smell in a room and hard to ignore a bad one. As such, I travel with scent everywhere I go, burning one cone or one stick at a time. Paine Products is the ORIGINAL balsam company, going strong since 1931. Naturally, balsam is for Christmastime and cedar is for the rest of the year, so we stock the cedar.
