Sugar & Other Yummy Things  
SWEDEN

The founding company of Bilar started out as a wallpaper and paint shop in 1885, but quickly expanded into all sorts of chemical wares such as shoeshine, perfumes etc. Along the way they started to make candy and, according to hearsay, these cars stemmed from a failed attempt at making toothpaste in 1953. Very few candies in Sweden have so many mysteries and we have witnessed highly intellectual persons debating whether there is actually any difference in taste between the different colored cars - bored Swedes have conducted blind-tests and some claim they can feel the difference. The official stance from sources within the company says they’re all the same, but we don't believe that - they DO taste different! Bilar claims to be the world’s most sold car. The design is based on a Bugatti sports car. They are to be eaten by the handful; while very yummy, they do share with other candies the ability to give you a stomach ache after a bag. Kind of like with booze: scarf responsibly!
