27" x 17.5" x 1.5"  
Eastern White Pine & Galvanized Nails  
USA

A graphic display for removing dirt, mud, and snow. The slats suck all that yucky stuff straight off. Stomping the feet works too, as the undesirable material falls straight through. Allows shoes to dry rather than having them sit in a pile of muck. In the city this can be a problem, as mudrooms with proper shoe storage can be uncommon, and a common hallway is all many of us have. I like the construction. Made by a father, William Tronsen, and his four sons in their barn for the past 35 years. Well, not the sons the entire time. Like many good things, what started as a hobby turned into a cottage industry. Now, do you have the arrows pointing in or out? Hello or Goodbye? I was always confused by the various doormats in our last building, the ones that say all sorts of wackadoodle things or are flower patterns or carpet-like. They are not very welcoming like this doormat. Yes, it will grow darker with dirt and age. After all the doormat talk, I have to introduce one last thing to you: bathmat. This is what we use it for; no more wet soggy things on the bathroom floor.
