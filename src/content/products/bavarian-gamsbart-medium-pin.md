5.5" x 3.5"  
Feathers, Deer Fur & Metal  
GERMANY

The traditional Gamsbart, on which this pin is based, is historically worn on Alpine hunters' hats. In theory, the size of the Gamsbart reflects the size of the owner's manliness. Franz Blumtritt and Sons was established in 1923, the founder's granddaughter Regina Erb now runs the company. Grandfather Blumtritt began with following traditional patterns from the Alps - time passed, and in the 50s one of his sons took some creative license and developed the collection they have today. The pieces are made in a workshop adjacent to their home. Ms. Erb works with a team of women, as she says women have the natural touch for the delicate work. The production method appears to be same as it was in the 20s, and their workshop has an amazingly historical feeling. Sadly, it appears the company will fold once she retires; her daughters do not have an interest in continuing the work. 98% of the feathers and all of the fur they use are provided by local hunters.
