12" x 23.5"  
Wood, Steel & Non-toxic Paint  
FINLAND

The 4th generation family firm Jujo Jussila produces Jukka toys. In 1923, they got their start by producing everyday wooden products such as ladders and electrical plates; in 1926, they made their first game \- Fortuna \- and have been producing top-notch toys ever since. Since the Finns claim Santa lives in Finland, I would venture to say Jukka is as close to Santa's toyshop as one could ever get. We were not allowed into a part of the factory - perhaps this is where one finds all his elves. Fortuna is reputed to be in every country home in Finland; since there are 5,238,460 people and likely half have a summer cottage, that means there are close to three million Fortuna games in Finland \- we hope to spread the magic.
