Teak Wood

<!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} -->

Woodworker Wayan, who started selling his carvings when he was nine, was taught by his father, who was taught by his father before, and now teaches his own son. This wooden carved knife was hand-chiseled from tropical hardwood. Balinese are intrinsically gentle people and this playful object is a softhearted way of making something that is notoriously linked with violence. Â - FE.
