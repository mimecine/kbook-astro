Sandalwood Oil  
INDIA

<!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} -->

Marco has not noticed how I am less picky about things since I have been back from India; when asked, he said, "Maybe relatively." Smell and scent have always been something which I refuse to budge on. Bad smells need to be eliminated and good smells have to be good, the best. Of all the senses, smell was the one most overwhelmed in India. Oddly, though, bad smells did not bother me as much, while good smells took me to a higher plane of existence. Unhappiness was dimmed and happiness was elevated. Now, back in the West, scent has been leveled off into mainly just OK. India forever changed my sense of and relationship to smell. Sandalwood oil was a scent I deliberately sniffed for while I was there. It has been said sandalwood aids in opening the Third Eye. This oil, pure Indian sandalwood oil, is made by the family business A.V. Kale & Sons in Pune, India. As sandalwood is being overharvested in India, they are careful to make sure they work with an ethical supplier. Even so, we will not be restocking the product, as scent is certainly less important than the planet. Without the Earth, we have no senses; without common sense, we have no Earth.
