"'The Bargain News' is not sold south of Westchester." "What's the hidden cost behind being in your exhibition?" "You can call Bob, he'll help you out." "You can call Rich, he'll help you out." "You can call Pete, he'll help you out." More like I can call my Dad, he'll help me out; I can call Jason's parents, they'll help me out. Almost anyone in CT will help us out except for "Bargain News" - they refuse to sell to us because we are in New York City. "What's the catch!" "I mean, why would anyone in New York want to read classified ads from Connecticut?" Hey, I would! It's an amazing look into the Yankee soul. Flip through and check out the things those Connecticuters are selling, it's eBay before eBay: Decorative Egg - Amish Doll - Ice Cream Chair - Balusters - Wagon Wheel - Trestle-Foot Table - Snow Boogie - Display Booth. Like it says on the cover: It's Hot.
