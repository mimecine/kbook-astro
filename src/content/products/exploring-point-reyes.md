Once upon a time, there was a little guidebook much treasured among both West Marin locals and carpetbaggers alike called _Point Reyes: Secret Places and Magic Moments_. It was a great little book by Phil Arnot and Elvira Monroe, and it lead you to great places, as promised by its great title. Then one sad day, the little great book grew up, cut its hair, got a straight job, and changed its name to _Exploring Point Reyes: A Guide to Point Reyes National Seashore_. The ladies of the store in town mourned the loss of its free ways, but in its heart of Tinkerbell hearts, it's still the same great old hippie guidebook. Use it! - G.G.
