9.5"Ã¸  
Cast Iron & Glaze  
THE NETHERLANDS

You know how good poffertjes are, right? Have you ever been to Peter Pan Bakery in Greenpoint for their donuts? Then you know how good they are and you know how good poffertjes are. Little, scrumptious, munchkin-sized, poofy little bites of goodness dusted in powdered sugar and served with a tiny fork. Not fried like donuts. Cooked in a hot pan, much like octopus balls. Munchkins, octopus balls and poffertjes...who knew? Who knows how many connections there are out there? Unfortunately, even though they are quite good, I have been unable to find these treats outside of the Netherlands. But I am sure they exist, maybe even in Pennsylvania Dutch country, although wait a minute, that Dutch is not Dutch- that is "Dutch" for Deutsch (German). Gotta keep looking. Or, wow - buy the pan and make them yourself and invite me over. I like THAT idea. Comes with a recipe using buckwheat flour and a touch of keukenstroop. According to the recipe, even more delicious when sprinkled with liqueur! You don't do that to donuts, do you? These tricks are not for kids! Don't forget the fork that matches the pan.
