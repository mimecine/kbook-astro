Paper & Rubber  
JAPAN

In 1923, Hirozo Nishijima, the man who discovered rubber bands in Japan, founded Kyowa Limited in Osaka. Apparently, he came up with the idea of using sliced bicycle tubes to hold money. Since 1951, Kyowa has produced over 35 styles of rubber bands presented in more or less the same design and packaging. Kyowa is the biggest seller of rubber bands in Japan. The graphics were designed by Shichiro Imatake, a Japanese pioneer of graphic design during the Showa period (1926â€“1989). He designed the packaging at the height of his career. Mr. Imatake was a big fan of New York, and when he passed away his remains were brought here.
