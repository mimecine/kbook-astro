Punch, punch...M.C. Mieth is one of two hand punch manufacturers left in the states. M.C. established his business in the 20s with his brother, P.J.. By 1952, they decided to head to a warmer climate so they moved the business down to Florida. Florida has an interesting railroad history - without it, the state would not have been nearly as developed today and the Florida citrus industry would have never become what it was/is. Florida is not for everyone, and apparently it did not agree with P.J., so he headed back north, but over time, M.C. bought his share of the business. At one point, we had so many railroads in the States that the railways had their own in-house punch making departments. Today we shamefully have far fewer railroads but M.C. Mieth is still going strong, providing punches to Amtrak, NJ Transit and the like. They stock over 1600 designs - it was hard for us to choose - I bet they have the match for your local coffee shop if you want to cheat on your cup card! Let us help you cheat. Made to last and it will. Comes with one design on the card, let us know what you like!
