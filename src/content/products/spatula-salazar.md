2.25" x 9"  
Wood & Silicone  
PORTUGAL

A kitchen utensil made for scraping bowls and avoiding waste is not a Portuguese exclusive. However, this particular model did attain symbolic status in Portugal, where it received the popular nickname “Salazar.” António de Oliveira Salazar, the dictator who ruled the country for 40 years, was a man who praised the virtues of poverty, even going so far as to state that “a people who are brave enough to be poor are an invincible people.” Scrape your bowls, people, and make do; life under a dictatorship is never pretty. I know, we had Bush. The Salazar regime ended in a non-bloody revolution in 1974 with a lot of butts being spanked with this spatula. No joke. Ok, joke about the butts, but not the revolution. Salazar died some years before the revolution by falling off his chair. What an ending! Strange. His time was clearly up!
