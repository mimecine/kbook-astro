8" x 2.5" x 1.5"  
Broom Root & Wood  
FINLAND

Scrub-a-dub-dub-dub…in my tub-tub-tub, but not with this brush. This brush is for cleaning the woven cotton rugs you find in every Finnish home or for scrubbing wood floors. Even though in Finland most people remove their shoes in the house, it is very typical for rugs to get dirty over the long winters. For this reason, the carpet beater, Havu Mänty Suopa, and this scrub brush are popular items. It is common for people to place their rugs in the snow and hand-beat them; the snow holding the debris. Likewise, taking the rugs to the sea and scrubbing them with this brush and some suopa is common - so common there are rug-cleaning docks for this purpose alone, even in Helsinki.
