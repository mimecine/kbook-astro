24"Ã¸  
Recycled Plastic  
SWEDEN

Rocko? It does not sound very Swedish to me. A sled? We were very skeptical. Not only is it small but how the heck could one fit on it? And never mind traveling downhill at a speed required for a successful sledding mission. Have you ever met the most beautiful hill in a park just after a snowfall and wanted your sled with you? Have you ever resorted to running to the corner store to buy black garbage bags as stand-ins? We have. The problem has always been where to store the sled 96% of the year when there is no snow on the ground. Here is the solution - the Rocko Flake, shaped in an "unique" form and modeled for the behind. Suspend all belief, doubt and fear and go for it. We put it to the test while we were in Sweden and it was brilliant. Oh, just get one...100% recycled plastic.
