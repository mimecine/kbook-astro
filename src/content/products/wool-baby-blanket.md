30" x 45"  
100% Hand Woven Wool  
SWEDEN

Babies can get cold; people can get cold too, but babies are extra-sensitive. Thatâ€™s why we feel they deserve a nice, warm, wool blanket for most of the year. With all the baby gifts we need to buy these days, we have done quite a bit of research on what is available in New York, the shopping capital of the USA. We found cotton, fleece, angora and cashmere - but what about a fine quality boiled wool!? It was nowhere to be found. So, of course, when we came across this blanket, made by a two-girl team of designers, it was easy to add to the collection. The overlock is a medium mustard yellow, so it suits either a boy or a girl. Many adults have wanted one for themselves. Even though this one is big enough for a small throw, with enough requests we might just bring them over. But for now, think of the babies and get them a nice, warm handmade blanket from Sweden!
