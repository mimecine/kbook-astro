Assorted Size, from .25"- 1"ø   
Brass  
SWEDEN

Buttons that are used on Swedish costumes. I recently discovered there is a difference between the folk costume and the national costumes. Folk costume or folkdräkt is a term only used for costumes from areas with a well-documented, locally distinctive form of dress. I had always assumed the costumes the Queen and Princesses wear are the folk costumes from their region, but when you think about it, how can the national royalty be from any region? They are the nation! The national costume, called Nationaldräkter, was developed in the romantic national period around 1900; it was designed by Märta Jörgensen, but she never saw that the design accepted as the process took 80 years...talk about Swedish contemplation! She wore her design until the day she died, feeling it was the peoples’ costume. The buttons are handmade in the traditional style, as they have been made for hundreds of years. The largest one, designed for the side button on the traditional skirt, is perfect on a winter coat. Manuela, who works with us, had a button "emergency" and used the medium one on her jeans; the small ones are great as a detail on children’s clothing. If there is one style you particularly like, please let me know.
