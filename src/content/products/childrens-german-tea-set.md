10" x 5" x 10"  
Aluminum & Bakelite  
PORTUGAL

A tea set for the little guys in your life. Let them make you breakfast in bed with their special serving set. Train them early to take care of you and you will have good assistance when you grow old. My first nephew inherited our wooden Creative Playthings kitchen two years ago and he used to love playing cook. Then my second nephew came along and started teaching number one the finer points of climbing and damaging Auntie's play kitchen. Now the kitchen is simply a jungle gym. They think it is really funny to climb in the sink and jump up and down. I don't think it is funny at all. My little guys won't be getting one of these sets anytime soon but hopefully you know someone a little more refined who deserves one.
