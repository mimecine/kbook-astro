7" x 9" x 5.5"  
Borosilicate Glass  
USA

Welcome to the world of Catamount Glass. It is a world I have been trying to gain access to for no less than 15 years, and I am happy to share it with you today. It all began when I was interning as a set designer and one of my first tasks was to go through a book Conran's published sometime in the '80s that contained a list of US manufacturers of industrial products recommended for the home. My job was to go through the list and see which manufacturers were still around, either by calling or sending a postcard. These were the days before the Internet was in widespread use, unbelievably. I remember when the Catamount catalog arrived, I was so taken with their work I proceeded to photocopy it for myself. Years later, I was going though my old set design files, tossing most of them out; I came across the Catamount catalog and found it just as interesting as before. At this point I owned Kiosk and we were just starting on our first American collection. I called, they sent me a new catalog, and that was that. Five years later we started working on America 4, focusing on things made in Vermont, and I remembered Catamount. Lo and behold!
