Does anyone send things in the post anymore? I think so. Even if not for post, these are good for handing over VIP things, like pictures and whatnot. I was thinking it could be good for sending an anonymous love letter to an office colleague. The envelope looks quite practical and businesslike, so no one in the mailroom or your love would guess it is anything personal or odd. This leads me to a question: you know how emails are censored at certain companies? Someone I know who worked at Bank of America was given a warning as they noticed she was emailing a personal file to herself (her baby shower list). No wonder these companies cost so much to run! Think of all the emails the snitches have to read in a day, and then think of how many snitches are employed by the bank to watch their employees, and think of the snitch-to-employee ratio! So I wonder, if email is now censored, why not go back to regular mail for personal correspondence? This plain envelope will go completely undetected. Get your company to pay the postage, too!
