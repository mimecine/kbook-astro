Tin, Plastic, Wire & Hooks  
ROMANIA

Two lures or lanterns, depending on how you see them. To me, they look very inspired by the Orient. We saw many Asian influences in Romania: in the clothing, the patterns, painting, objects and such. One particular fresco of Mary comes to mind, it was heavily influenced by Tibetan art. We found these lures in Obor Market in Bucharest. They were short on stock as they sell fast, so we made an order to be collected one week later. Although we were specific, the same colors were not used on what was delivered. When asked, we believe the woman replied to us, in Romanian, "the fish don't see, they only smell." We gathered this was her explanation as she pointed to the lure, made a sign of a fish, pointed to her eye, then said NU (no), then pointed to her nose and then DA (yes). However, it could have just as easily been an ancient curse. But she is correct after all - the fish surely don't consider the color. If these were little Oriental lanterns and fish were drawn to light rather than smell, that would be another story. Let me wrap it up by telling you she changed them out for us, delivered as promised and we all had a good laugh. I think?
