Marco insisted on this product - I asked why as he doesn't like grapefruit, although I have noticed he has always had a thing for citrus spoons. I think it is like the spork, just weird and kind of revolutionary. Anyway, he loved this one as the package reads "Instant Neat". "Instant Neat"? When he told me I asked him, "what the hell does that mean?" Honestly, English is my first language and it is his third - what was he hearing that I was unable to tune into? On the package the words are grouped together inside a very peppy circle. He explained he read it as "Instantly Rad", you know, because people use the word "neat" to mean "cool" or "rad". Hmmm, not the answer I was expecting. A "rad" citrus spoon - okay, that's cool, what do you think it does to the grapefruit upon contact? Could this somehow be linked to the Fountain of Youth and the mythological South American cities with streets paved in gold? You know, Florida was first explored by the Spanish in 1513, around the time Cortés was looking for gold. Golden citrus - the grapefruit - I think Marco might be onto something. You might wonder why there are two distinct ends on the spoon - also called a "Pluck and Scoop" spoon - the smaller end is used for plucking out the seeds while the larger end is used for scooping out the fruit.
