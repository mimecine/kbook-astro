There comes a time in everyone's life when things just need to go a little bit easier. I noticed the "easy factor" happens in stages, and generally the changes seem to be trivial, but in reality, when considered, have a great effect on one's being. Take, for instance, your 20s, when you decided to stop washing dishes with a skanky sponge and you splurged on a dish brush - a reaction to developing dishpan hands. Then, in your 30s, you broke down and bought a tea strainer, since in your early 20s you bought lots of teapots, but then you never found the time to make and drink a whole pot of tea. I heard the 40s are for shoehorns, although I noticed Europeans tend to want one when they are in their 30s. And so all this conversation leads us to The Shrimper, a little device made for the "easy factor" - I mean, why peel shrimp when The Shrimper can do it for you, all in one swoop.
