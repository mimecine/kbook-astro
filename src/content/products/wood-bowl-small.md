7.5" x 2.5"  
Maple  
USA

Glass, plastic, metal. What is the obsession with all things totally man-made? You know what looks better on the table and feels better in the hand? Wood. You know what looks better with age instead of just getting greasy, rusty, or dented? Wood. What have humans been making stuff out of for more than 100,000 years? Not glass or plastic, that’s for sure. The large is just right for - you got it - salads, or for holding fruits. The small has a low profile and is just big enough for one serving of salad or a heaping pile of sauteed greens for the table. Don’t forget the nuts. Yum. Wait, don’t eat the bowl, silly, unless you're a nasty termite. Made by our pals over at the Bowl Mill. This is the typical Vermont-made wooden bowl that has made Vermont wooden bowls so famous. You know about them, right?
