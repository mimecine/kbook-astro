3.5" x 3.5" x 6"  
Teak Wood

 &lt;!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --&gt;

Woodworker Wayan, who started selling his carvings when he was nine, was taught by his father, who was taught by his father before, and now teaches his own son. The hand-chiseled wooden blocks are simple in their shape and function yet can be used as a multi-purposed playful item - candle holders, door stoppers, book ends, or simply for stacking and re-stacking.
