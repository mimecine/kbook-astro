Coconuts & Paint  
HONG KONG

Found at a market in Hong Kong, an interesting object given to the parents of brides as part of the Chinese wedding tradition. Double Happiness. I was also told characters for coconut equal the words father and son. I know no Cantonese. If a live coconut is given, it is considered good luck if it sprouts. Keep for 100 days. Just one of those objects that make you wonder about humans and the world. What a glorious place. We don't want to ship coconuts with double happiness written on them around the planet if you don't want them; so please, let us know if you would like us to order you a pair, and be sure to tell us why. I'm taking notes on all these things, you know. Without the notes, how do you think I will be able to recall such things when I grow old, and my coconut is half nutty? Stay in touch.
