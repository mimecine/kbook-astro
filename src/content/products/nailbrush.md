ROMANIA

My nails got dirty in Romania, I was digging into all sorts of crap. Whether it was at a factory, on a hillside, in a forest, or at someone's home - I was digging. New York is a dirty place too and for months I was looking for a decent, simple nailbrush, an honest type of tool. Unfortunately, I could not find one that was not wood, loudly branded or part of an entire nail kit. So I seized the moment and nabbed one of these for myself. I knew there was something right-on about it when we were visiting a factory and I saw it being produced. Somehow different from our brushes but I can't nail it down. Oh wow, that is a pun.
