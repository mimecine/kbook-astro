3"Ã¸ x 11.5"  
Booze  
GERMANY

I first came across the French counterpart of this divine fluid years ago, visiting a friend in Antibes on the French Riviera (sounds fancy, huh? read on...). We were staying in her parent's house and we needed an aperitif to go with the sundown - nothing else was available in the cabinet (we were broke and had no money to buy anything) than this odd pear booze. First sips were not really to my taste, but soon I couldn't have enough of it (truth be told, you can). This particular German strain is called Obstler and in the German tradition it is a mixture of apple and pear. Ours comes from a quite small supplier on the Bodensee/Lake Konstanz which is where Germany, Austria and Switzerland meet. The Bodensee is known for its fruit production, as it is a microclimate with favorable growing conditions. It is just like the French variant, something to get used to, BUT IT IS WORTH IT. I like it out of the freezer.
