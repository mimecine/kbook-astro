7" x 3"  
Tin  
MEXICO

Life-sized, hi-speed rescue vessel for rodents. Yes, it could possibly fit a teeny-weeny mouse instead of Tintin, but since I'd hate to make animals suffer I must strongly advise against such usage. (I once picked up a mouse from the ground as a child, and the poor creature instantly had a heart attack and went to mouse heaven; Iâ€™d like to help them but can no longer take the risk.) This boat is fueled by a small candle placed in the holder; it produces steam that propels the vessel through water. A little dangerous in the tub but fun in the park. Comes with instructions and in red, blue, or green with different Mexican cities written on the side. This one could also be used as a miniature reenactment of the Exxon Valdez disaster if overfilled with oil. Adults may only have it on a bookshelf.
