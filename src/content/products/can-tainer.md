Can, can, Can-Tainer. Have you been to Key West? Seen all the tourists on their fat-tired cruisers? No, not their sneakers or their asses, but their bicycles. Whoops! How the heck do you bike around and look at all those pretty little buildings without something to hold your coffee? I mean, you have to have your java with you! Actually, I have sincerely felt traveling with coffee is a problem when I bike to the office in the morning as my favorite coffee shop is along the way. Without fail, I buy a coffee, put it into my basket and spill some on my bag during the rest of my trip. Now my coffee cup goes strait into my Can-Tainer. Ride your fat-tired bike and do the can-can while your coffee sits securely in the Can-Tainer. I love the name - I can't stop saying it...Can-Tainer, Can-Tainer, Can-Tainer.
