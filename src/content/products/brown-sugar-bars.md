5" x 1.5"  
Sugar  
HONG KONG

Yum! Have you eaten a bowl of warm, soft tofu? If so, you should try breaking this up over it next time. Not so into tofu? Then try it over hot oatmeal! Little nibbles when on a sugar low work too. I carried a few bars around in my bag to feed to Marco whenever I saw the light fading from his eyes at the end of the day. His daily line was: "No more shops...no more talks...no more objects to consider...no more travel!" A little sugar in these situations can go a long way, especially when the husband starts complaining in the seventh hour and you have four more to go. Sugar or electronics shopping, you choose. Consisting of very pure sugar cane, this is a common ingredient in New Year's cakes but can be found all through the year. It is really yummy and crumbly and sweet in a good way. Please store in a dry place.
