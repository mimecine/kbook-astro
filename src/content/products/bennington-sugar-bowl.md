4" x 4" x 4"  
Stoneware  
USA

As I take issue with the name "creamer," I also take issue with the name "sugar" bowl. I hate to say it: cream and sugar are delicious, but they are not the best thing for you. That's ok, but try moving on. Over breakfast we call the creamer a milker and the sugar bowl a spice bowl. Not to make a point, but we just do, we don't think about it. Maybe Marco is too thin as a result, but I don't care. Bennington Potters was established in 1948 by David Gil. He was fascinated with creating pottery that had the integrity of a handcrafted piece but was produced with the assistance of a machine. Still today, the clay is formed with the help of the machine but every piece is hand-finished. Bennington Potters is one of the last manufacturers of American pottery out there. It was an industry that could not compete with off-shore competition. What a beautiful shape this bowl has.
