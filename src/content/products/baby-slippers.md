3" x 4" x 2"  
Wool  
USA

While it is true most children do not like things on their feet, they also don't like pants, but they wear them. I don't like the thought of my nephew running around in his tie-dye and socks and shoes with no pants. Very uncool. However, he is too young to know socks and t-shirts with no pants is a bad combination. Hopefully he figures that out before he turns 14. Babies are even more naive to style and function. So naive they refuse to wear booties, but not quite so naive that they don't recognize these are some stylish booties. Too stylish to go unworn. You catch my drift? You tell us if any of those babies give you trouble putting these babies on and we will have a talk with them. Carol has been working with wool her entire life. She spins her wool, teaches knitting, holds workshops, and has a store too. All the while supplying us with these booties for the babies. She's right on!
