6.5" x 2.5"  
Nylon  
HONG KONG

When I think Hong Kong I think green, possibly because in America green is the color of money and Hong Kong is all about trade and finance, so subconsciously it makes sense. The shape of this twine reminds me of an ancient Chinese coin, so again this object refers to money. Being that the object is twine, I am not sure how rope is connected to money unless one considers the possibility of kidnapping and ransom. That thought leads me to a Hong Kong martial arts movie from the '70s which is centered around a wealthy man's kidnapping. By the way, did you know Bruce Lee was raised in Hong Kong and Jackie Chan was born in Hong Kong?
