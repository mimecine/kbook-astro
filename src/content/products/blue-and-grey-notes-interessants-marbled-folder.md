PORTUGAL

When something is lodged in the head it tends to show itself again in strange places, at odd moments, with weird coincidences. I was not looking for a folder, I was only looking. There was only one. It somehow spoke to me, called me, from under a pile of other less stimulating gray and beige babies. What happened next was long-winded but pretty simple: we tracked it down, packed it up, and shipped it to New York. I came back to my office. A week went by and then two; still the boxes were not here. I continued to think of the folder, among other things as well... doing laundry, accounting, etcetera. Then in my haze of thought, I looked up and blindly gazed at an article about Miro that I had printed out many, many years ago. Suddenly the folder! It was there, clear, large on the page. Funny, how some objects can be magical; they trail you around until you pick them up and take them home with you, insisting you care for them. Miro's folder is labeled "Notes Interessants."
