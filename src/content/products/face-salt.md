2.25" x 2.5"  
Salt, Almond Oil & Honey  
GERMANY

We decided to go to Bad Reichenhall when I discovered it was a center for salt production since the Middle Ages. Wandering around, there was not much going on - it was the dead of winter just after a wind storm. People still visit the well-known town to take the waters and several types of curative products are locally produced, varying from lozenges to bath salts. To be honest, most products either tasted or smelled not-so-great. At one small pharmacy in the center, we saw the Balneo products and were intrigued by their simple blue and white packaging. We were given their address and proceeded to visit them, they were easy to find as they are situated directly across from the major salt works Ludwig I built in the early 19th century. The current owners purchased the firm in the 1920s. They have a history with the town as their grandfather established the first local spa in the 1800s. The salt is famous for its purity, it exfoliates and brings elasticity to stressed skin that needs a little boost. In New York City, I think we can all use a little boost. Fresh, fresh, fresh and 100% pure.
