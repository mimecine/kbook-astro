20" x 25" x 30"  
Handmade Printed Cotton Canvas  
USA

Salvor, known for their prints. KIOSK, known for its love of folding furniture. Telescope, making things for 103 years. Telescope first made the frame in 1972. We wanted canvas, we thought of Salvor, we asked for the prints. Salvor produced the prints, we sent the fabric to Telescope, Telescope made the chairs, and what you see today is a result of three independent American companies working together. Work with what people do best, work with their limitations in mind, make it happen, make good products that people can use and enjoy. This is the goal and why we are doing what we do.
