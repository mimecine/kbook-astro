7" x 1.75" x .5"  
Almonds, Honey, Sugar, Vanilla & "Hostie"  
FRANCE

As you might imagine, visiting this maker was of little burden for us. At 6 am, beginning with the hand-roasting of the almonds in a machine more than 100 years old, the confiseurs start their day. The almonds are roasted, the honey and sugar is heated to a liquid, the temperature is precise; then the fresh roasted almonds are added to the hot honey-sugar liquid and, at a moment's notice, the nougat is ready to be poured into wooden molds lined with HOST - yes, sheets of the wafer you get as communion, if you are into such things. I was unaware host is used in nougat preparation, but it's so common in France they found it odd for me to suggest making nougat without. How does one explain baking paper or nonstick cooking spray as an option, yes, this is the technique commonly known in America. Andre Boyer, established in 1887, makes a delicious nougat blanc and an even more delicious nougat noir. It tastes of almonds and the local honey, nothing more, as nothing more is necessary.
