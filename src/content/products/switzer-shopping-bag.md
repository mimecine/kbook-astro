Canvas & Leather  
THE NETHERLANDS

Switzer, located in the heart of Amsterdam, makes things out of canvas. This is predictable, as it's situated directly on one of the many canals of the city, and canals are filled with boats that are filled with things made of canvas. While waiting for a customer in need of, say, a boat cover, they make handy bags. The canvas is vexingly well waxed. The construction allows the bag to slide superbly over the handlebars of your bike, which is why we saw so many Amsterdamians swoosh by us with one on each side, rocking in harmony as they pedaled their way home. The jovial duo behind Switzer, Fritz and Arnaud, would only agree to make a few bags for us if we arranged for a friendly soul to collect them. We did, and we hope the three of them had a beer and some herring on the Westermarkt before parting ways. According to F & A, it's the only place to go for herring and it is delicious. Jason tells me he is stopped on the street whenever he walks with a Switzer bag, accosted by other Switzer fans - it appears to be an informal club.
