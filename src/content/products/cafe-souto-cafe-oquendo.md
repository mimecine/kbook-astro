Coffee   
USA

Miami, Cuba, Little Havana - I have dreams of doing a Cuba collection for KIOSK. How exciting...how to do it? Special "Design Research Visa" please, Mr. Obama. For now, I have to settle for Miami, which is pretty good. While visiting Little Havana, we stopped in for a few Cuban coffees - "Versailles" being the largest and most crowded café. It's interesting - the name didn't make logical sense at the time, but I have never forgotten it, so it works. Anyway, Cuban coffee is made with espresso and sugar. Some sugar is placed in a container (preferably metal, like the one we also have) and the espresso is brewed directly into the same pot - ideally a little bit - then stirred and then the rest of the espresso is added. It's strong and the sugar is a double-whammy follow-up. At Versailles, it is really nice to go to the walk-up window and have a guava pastry with your coffee. Damn, it's a reason in itself to visit Miami! In 1865, the founder of Rowland Coffee, Mr. Souto, started brewing Cuban-style coffee, Cafe Bustelo currently being their most famous brand. Oquendo and Souto are both espresso coffees and a good start if you are interested in brewing your own Cafecito, Café Cubano, Cuban espresso, Cuban pull, Cuban shot, etc. I am drinking some now. (P.S. A customer told me two things: 1. Versailles is called Versailles because of the mirrors in their main dining hall. - and - 2. There was a Versailles in Havana.)
