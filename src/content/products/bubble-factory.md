You know that person you met on a beach holiday when you were in second grade who you never stopped thinking about? He was a little different, a little special. He looked like Charlie from your favorite movie at the time, the one you still watch for comfort every now and again. His hair was blonde blonde, almost white. He wore a bikini. He was not like the other boys. Nothing went on, but you had a lot of fun together, and you never stopped thinking about him from time to time. Then, years later, you are checking your childhood photo album - your mother obsessively took images of you as you were the firstborn - and you see him standing with you on the beach. You have a floppy hat on. You are both camera shy, and shy with each other. You realize he looks how your husband must have looked when he was that age. You're stunned. You are so glad what life is and how the big circle has so many little circles inside it that constantly collide. This bubble factory, it's kind of like that. I've never stopped thinking about it, hours of fun in the sun... Runs on hand crank, has circles, makes spheres. I don't remember that little boy's name. He was from Canada, and we were on the Cape. That's all. To use, pour a small amount of bubble liquid, maybe one-half inch of liquid at most, into one of the two indentations on the front of the factory. Make sure the crank is placed into the machine correctly so it does not pop out while turning. You may have to do some trial and error to get the balance right. Have fun.
