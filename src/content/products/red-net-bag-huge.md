52" long  
Nylon  
HONG KONG

Recently at KIOSK we ran out of storage space, so we had to take to the ceiling. We filled up a bunch of these huge net bags with inventory and, being careful not to overload them as they get quite heavy, we hung them from the ceiling pipes. Right now we have balls, frying baskets, mailboxes, and the tea/coffee pots stored above. One for each product. If you have pipes on your ceiling, hang the bags with our S-Hook or simply place the bag on a nail or any type of wall hook. It's one of those "It's that easy" products, made for TV! I think it would come in really handy if you have kids. Out of reach but never out of mind.
