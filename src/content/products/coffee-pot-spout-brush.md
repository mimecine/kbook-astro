SWEDEN

Sweden is ranked #2 in the world for coffee consumption, just behind Finland and just ahead of Norway and Denmark. In 2003, the consumption of coffee beans was 97,320 tons for a country of 8 million people! I wonder how that compares to New York City alone. As you might imagine, coffee is part of the national culture and psyche. One positive thing to come out of this is the fika, which is particularly an afternoon ritual for grandmothers, at-home moms and anyone on the weekends. It involves going to a cozy cafe and sitting down with a friend to chat over a nice cup of coffee and a slice of cake or bun. It's a great ritual and a national pastime. This brush is designed to clean your coffee pot spout but given I don't have a coffee pot, I use it on my teapot and it works just great! Made by an association that employs visually impaired people to produce their products by hand.
