Paper & Metal Wire  
SWEDEN

In Sweden this type of lottery is called an "American Lottery" - sounds strange, but the concept is enviably simple. Each ticket is perforated in the middle so you can easily tear off one side and give it to the loser / winner. When you have sold out of hope (tickets) the seller breaks open the sealed metal ring and puts the stubs from the ring in a container for mixing and selecting. This kind of ticket has been around forever. In Sweden, you have to apply for a permit to hold a lottery unless you are a registered sports club; therefore you often find these being sold at soccer matches. The ring makes it easy to walk around with. We have heard many comments that this would make a great necklace - in fact, our friend Lucie made one!
