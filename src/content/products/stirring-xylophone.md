4.5"Ã¸ x up to 6" high  
Wood & Beeswax  
SWEDEN

Random tones which go up, and then down. Spinning in circles, or knocking back and forth. Sounds a bit like water drops, or the African instrument I heard when hiking Kilimanjaro. I'll never forget that sound. For musical children who might enjoy cooking. Entirely produced in Sweden. What follows are the maker's melodic words: "We try to meet the need for true tone and beauty that every person carries as an inner longing. Our intention is to inspire the players to awaken their curiosity, and lust, for playful musical creativity. The process of making a new instrument always starts with careful examination of the basic natural phenomena related to it. We try to refine the most typical qualities of each instrument. By evoking and releasing the inherent sonorous potential of the material, we make instruments that appear in their most simple and genuine beauty. The exclusive choice of materials and the characteristic design is the result of our aim for perfection of sound, as well as function. The most significant and fundamental goal of Auris is to achieve harmony between what the ear hears, the hand feels, and the eye sees." Plinky plunk.
