GREECE

In Greece, it seems like everyone has their own citrus, pomegranate, or walnut trees, and, of course, grapevines. When I went to buy fruit, I was always told: Wait a day, I'll bring you some from my tree, or my vine, or my bush, out at the family house, or from my mother's, or my grandfather's. Naturally, with all this growing going on, they also make a variety of edibles and drinkables, including wine. Wine, as you know, is a popular beverage in Greece; hence, in every kitchen shop, the wine jug is as common as a coffee pot. Good on big picnics or road trips, as it is easy to transport and pour.
