Steel Alloy with Glass Lens  
USA

This is a very much so discontinued item due to the Manufacturer deliberately overcharging us on an order and after three months of our calling to discuss the issue they advised us "We have much bigger customers who don't have any issues with our policies, take it or leave it." and "You don't want to go down that road" when I suggested I would not pay the invoice until I was charged the correct (lower) amount. I mean, the customer is never right correct? I figure after all those years of catering to the US military and hosing them down they assume they can push invoices through unnoticed. Thanks AO Eyewear for screwing us in the end after giving you two and a half years of business. Definitely Discontinued, I'd rather give someone else our hard earned cash.
