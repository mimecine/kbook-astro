Little lichens from the forest come upon you.  
You come upon them.  
Growing slowly  
they vibrate as the fall approaches  
and the vegetation disappears.  
You want to lick the rock they inhabit.  
But rather you lick the plate  
when you are done with dinner,  
done with dessert.  
You run your finger  
around the edge of the cup  
at the end of your coffee.  
You have no reservation  
as you skim the surface.  
Dirt is not in the mix.  
You do not hesitate.  
Your food loves the plate.  
Your eyes love the dish.  
Your roommate loves the cup.  
Your brother loves the big cup.  
Your everything loves everything.  
Betty Roytburd has made ceramics  
which love you  
and you love.  
  
A large oval platter for serving: kale, fish, carrots, cookies.  
A small round plate for serving: pickles, avocado, ume.  
A long cup for drinking: espresso.  
A big cup for drinking: hojicha, apple cider, cold tea.  
A round plate for eating: sandwiches, salad, omelette.
