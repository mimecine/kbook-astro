2" x 2", 10 g.  
Mineral Oil, Camphor, Menthol & Fragrance  
HONG KONG

A true crossover product. There is a US-made Mentholatum but the packaging is nowhere as sweet as the Chinese variant. The story is a little confusing. Mentholatum was created in the US in 1889. In 1920, a missionary in Japan acquired the distribution rights. In 1991, Mentholatum Japan founded a Chinese division. Our coworker in Hong Kong pointed out the product as an object from her childhood. So the question was, did it arrive to Hong Kong via Japan? We did a bit of research and found out it is from Japan, and, interestingly enough, the package is by the same designer who did the O'Band rubber bands in our Japanese collection, Mr. Imatake! Thank you! Oh, the world is SO small.
