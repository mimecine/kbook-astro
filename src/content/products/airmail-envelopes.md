5" x 10"  
Paper  
HONG KONG

Actually, I do remember a time when airmail envelopes were necessary objects. At a very young age I started fantasizing about travel, developing a network of global pen pals: Japan, Bulgaria, Greece, Haiti, Great Neck (no need for an airmail envelope)... I don't know what we wrote about, but I do remember the need to use an airmail envelope when posting. The requirement of a specific envelope made the effort all the more exciting. I am not sure if I was drawn to the graphics (aesthetics) or the idea of the postman clearly prioritizing my letter which was so loudly marked for special VIP \[suggestion\] treatment via air delivery (function). Quite common in Hong Kong, the envelopes take me back. They say both "travel" and "exotic" in one glimpse.
