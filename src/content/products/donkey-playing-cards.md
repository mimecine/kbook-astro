Paper  
PORTUGAL

Litografia Maia has been producing playing cards since 1926, making them the oldest card producer in Portugal and one of the oldest in Europe. They use a special paper with a finish that is exceptionally smooth and produces sharp sounds while shuffling or messing around. You might be wondering "Why the Donkey?" A popular kids' card game in Portugal is "Burro em PÃ©" or "Standing Donkey." The objective of the game is simple: get rid of your cards. "Donkey" in Portuguese also means "stupid," so essentially you are the stupid ass if you are the last one holding cards. We came across an interesting game at a village feast; I called it "Hammer a nail into a log." You should have seen the crowds surrounding that competition. When they cleared out, I swooped in to photograph the cards on the log. The expression I got was "Donkey!" in Portuguese, of course...
