11.5"Ã¸, 8 on a string  
Plastic & Nylon  
HONG KONG

When we visited Hong Kong it was right before Chinese New Year and we were lucky enough to see the start of all of the holiday decorations. We spotted the pinwheels hanging on Jade Street in a fairly touristic area. We asked a shopkeeper about them and of course we were completely mocked, they really laughed: why would these foreigners want the pinwheel and not the jade? I know, I know, but where did you get it? They sent us on our way but we only found more and more pinwheels hanging, and none in the stores. Days went by, and, reluctant to give up, I kept trying; finally, on day three we found them in a random paper store. Much about Hong Kong appears random when in actuality it is not. They really lighten-up any mood, like in the cartoon when the scene changes with a spiraling image; they transport you to another place and time. Why did Hitchcock use the spiral in "Vertigo"?
