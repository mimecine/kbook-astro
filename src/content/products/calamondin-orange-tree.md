A Tree!  
USA

Oh, your own little orange tree from Florida that, at first, will only produce mini-oranges but over time, as you nurture it, will grow bigger and the oranges will too. Soon you will have enough for a glass of juice one Sunday a year, and then two Sundays, and then two glasses of juice at a time. It really depends on how much love you let shine on your orange tree. Plants react to conversation and tender care. My grandmother always swore the more she talked to her plants (the CO2 emissions) and pulled on their limbs the heartier and better they would grow. I think it is nice to have a little Florida citrus in your home to connect with the carton of Tropicana in the fridge, 100% Florida oranges inside, you know? This little guy cannot be shipped to other citrus-producing states, so please don't ask, we hate to disappoint. "A day without Florida orange juice is like a day without sunshine!" A 9.3 billion-dollar industry was built on that jingle.
