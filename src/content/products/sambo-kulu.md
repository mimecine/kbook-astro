**The package is very carnival-like and fun. The contents are yummy: slightly salty licorice coated in chocolate. It’s a pretty basic and delicious candy in a pretty package. Enough for two, three, six or even eight depending on how much everyone likes sweets. With three in the car and two hours of driving, we did OK with one bag of Kulu and one Djupur. It’s made with consideration, love, good jokes and eccentric behavior by Kolus, the owner of which is credited with inventing the concoction of licorice and chocolate in the 1970s. If you want the best, you should always go to the source!**
