9 bulbs  
Garlic!  
ROMANIA

You know what they say about Transylvania? Yes, it is in Romania, and garlic and you-know-who - the Vlad, the Dracula. How could we resist adding garlic into the collection when we were in the countryside of Transylvania and we heard wolves howling and I looked up and saw the garlic bulb hanging over the door with an inscription next to it. Yes, I swore to myself right then, as I was locking the door and dragging a chair over to it, that if I made it through the night I would find the best garlic to add to the Romanian collection. Call it a sorcerer's foolery, but it was my pact with Vlad the Dracula and I made it through the evening. Luckily for me, the garlic tastes delicious too. It's quite sweet. Not as loud as the garlic of Provence.
