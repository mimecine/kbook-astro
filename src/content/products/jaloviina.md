16.5 fl oz.  
Cognac & Alcohol  
FINLAND

A Helsinki friend introduced Jaloviina to us; he was stunned we had never tried it. A delicate blend of cognac and vodka - also called "cut brandy" - apparently many an artist has sat with their Jaloviina bottle. There is some truth in the myth - the same night we were introduced to Jaloviina I did notice a creative type at an adjacent table with his journal and a glass of alcohol that looked suspiciously like the ONE. He was deep in a moment. Jaloviina comes in one star and three star variants. The stars signify the % of cognac in the mix. If you are the real deal, go for the one star; posers go for the three. It’s kind of like the goodie-goodie in the class who always had all the multiple stars while the really cool types got only one, because they truly knew what was the shit.
