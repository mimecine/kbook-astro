4" x 5" x 4"  
Stoneware  
USA

Called a creamer, but I would rather say milker, as I am not a big cream drinker and I don't think many people truthfully are any more. Or maybe I am wrong. Wow, I had to do a bit of research, and what I found shocked me. Milk sales since 1987 have almost halved, whereas cream sales have almost doubled. OMG, you are fat, America! We will call this one a creamer, indeed. This CREAMER is a bit big for breakfast coffee or tea, but the right size for the hot bowl of morning porridge. I don't eat much sugar, so the sugar bowl - its partner in crime - I use for a ground spice mix for the porridge. Are you an oatmeal or a cream of wheat person in the morning? Bennington Potters was established in 1948 by David Gil. He was fascinated with creating pottery that had the integrity of a handcrafted piece but was produced with the assistance of a machine. Still today, the clay is formed with the help of the machine but every piece is hand-finished. Bennington Potters is one of the last manufacturers of American pottery out there. It was an industry that could not compete with off-shore competition. Gorgeous round form on this milker.
