Cotton & Wool  
USA

For years I had sworn off down for ethical reasons, but you know what, I have never slept well under blankets or synthetic comforters. The weight never felt great and the warmth was not evenly distributed. Oh, it's so cozy having a wool comforter on the bed now. It's cool when it gets warm inside, and warm when it gets cold - and we have plenty of ups and downs with our landlord. Some of you out there might be interested to hear that it is dust mite resistant. Our supplier is a wool processor that has been in business for 101 years. I like that! It means they know how to make them, and they know how to maintain them, with washing done at a reasonable cost. Dive right into a cradle of wool, it's fluffy.
