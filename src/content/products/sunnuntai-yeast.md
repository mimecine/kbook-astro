Dry Yeast  
FINLAND

Sunnuntai means “Sunday” in Finnish and what a beautiful, rosy Sunday it is. There is a whole product line of baking goods called Sunnuntaiwith everything from margarine to flour and dry yeast. All that you need for a good day's baking. In principle, baked goods are a Sunday requirement for after church or with the afternoon coffee. The idea is each housewife should have the time to bake a good cardamom bun. Based on the range of Sunnuntai products out there, I do believe it. However, here in the States, I think it would be a bit of a stretch - not many people bake any longer...although, there is no better option than your own baked goods. But what would Atkins say?
