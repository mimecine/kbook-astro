ITALY  
Plastic  
11.5" x 8.5" x 11"

What has always troubled me, when I did not have the space or need for super large bottles, was how to keep my water bottles and wine bottles in order. They tend to scatter and knock around. They bother my fruits and veg. in the bag. They take over. I decided one day things were going to change; that was the day I found a way to separate them, to put the unruly bullies into one room as a group. To place them in the playpen and leave them there to bother each other and no one else. When they really get bad I open them and drink them. Then, when they are half or one-quarter less of what they were, I put them back in the playpen with their other one-quarter companions or whole friends. There, they can debate who is the winner and who is the looser. That discussion goes on until they are recycled and / or refilled to be used again. At which point the cycle starts over. They seem to like their little home and endless discussions. Some get quite fizzy at first.
