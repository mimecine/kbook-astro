I remember sitting around with Margaret Maude in the kitchen with all the girls. We would watch her shuck a husk, peel an apple in one go, or push the peas out of their pods. We would follow her lead all afternoon, knowing that we were helping to lay the foundation of a castle of a meal. Grandma doesn't come to my apartment to cook, and the girls all have girls of their own to help with the husks, pods and peels. Me? I have Mr. Pea Sheller, the radio blasting and a glass of wine. Built to last. Yummy peas at the market - who wants to take hours to shell them by hand when you have your Mr. Mister to help you? Shells a bushel of peas in about 30 minutes. Hand crank can be hooked up to most mixers for some seriously speedy shelling. Comes with instructions.
