18.25" x 10"  
Rattan & Varnish  
FINLAND

There was a time when I checked coats for a living. It was in college. I also pulled the wine from the cellar. I was working at an Italian restaurant and the food remains to this day some of the best Italian food I have ever eaten. I got delicious meals and lived off of tips. At the time, it felt very top-notch, just the place to be. I can't recall the place's name. At that time in life, hangers were a perpetual issue. The Finns know how to make them for winter coats. This is one big, rattan hanger. One I never stopped thinking about, even five years after I saw it, many, many years after being a coat-check girl. Some days, more and more often, I long for the simplicity of that job. I think I smelled the roses more then. Repetition is undervalued.
