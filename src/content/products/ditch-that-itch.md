Olive Oil, Cleavers, Chickweed & Beeswax  
USA

Mosquitoes are bad. Worse than ever thanks to global warming, I figure! I have been bitten up and down the coast in more places \- and more times \- than I can count. While we were driving around Massachusetts being swarmed, I needed a new remedy as ours was not holding up. I caught sight of "Ditch That Itch!" and decided \- okay, why not give it a go? Not only does it work, but it really works, I mean really, really. Berkshire mosquito bites, be gone! We traveled onward to visit our friend on the North Shore \- everyone was scratching at the table and complaining, so I decided to share after holding out for two days. This product requires rationing if you only have one small jar! Again \- itch, be gone! All of the picky chicks around the table were in awe, and if they were not immediately converted, they soon jumped on the bandwagon. I currently consider this to be the perfect hostess gift. I am writing this at the end of September in New York City and we still have plenty of mosquitoes; some things never go out of fashion. Smells like beeswax.
