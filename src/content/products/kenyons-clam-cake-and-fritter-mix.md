Treading for clams ain't easy, you've got to find them with your feet in the mud, real slow and careful, delicate and such. Don't forget to bring your floating bucket for all the clams you are going to find! After you've got a bucket full and likely a bad sunburn on your neck, head back home and dig out your Clam Ram, it's always kept in the middle-right drawer. Let the clams rest for a good half hour in a cool area with a cold towel on them, so they settle down; a stressed clam won't open! Now, ram away! When you have a pile of clams, get out your Kenyon's Clam Cake and Fritter mix, the best for more than 100 years! You can chop the clams up and make cakes out of them or do as I do: take the whole clam, coat it in milk, dip it in Kenyon's, and do a little deep-fry. Digging, dipping, and deep-frying!
