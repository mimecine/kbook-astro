Paper, Pretty Pictures & Great Text  
SWEDEN

**This book takes its title from a series of Swedish nature documentaries. Its images of nature dioramas present a beautiful blend of still life painting with a dash of drama. The hare is caught mid-jump. A snake poses coiled. This is nature as you didn’t know you could see it. If you can’t walk into nature you can look or read about it and think about being in it. The book was produced by the independent publisher “Journal” in Sweden. A fascinating essay by Magnus Bärtås offers an analysis of early diorama production and the associated habits of catching, documenting and preserving nature. The majority of the images were taken at the Biological Museum in Stockholm—one of my all-time favorite museums—with paintings by Bruno Liljefors and taxidermy by Gustaf Kolthoff, a man known to have both a preserved and a live owl in his studio. It is said visitors often could not tell them apart. Bärtås uses the term “sculptured sceneography” to describe the work.**
