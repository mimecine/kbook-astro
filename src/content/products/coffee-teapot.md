8" x 5.5"  
Aluminum & Plastic  
HONG KONG

Produced by one of the oldest manufacturers in Hong Kong, this is technically a coffee pot. However, in Hong Kong, it is also the standard pot for making milk tea. Milk tea in Hong Kong is not just milk tea, it is Ceylon tea with evaporated milk and sugar and it is delicious. (So is a "duo," which is half coffee and half tea with evaporated milk.) The tea is brewed using a "tea sock" (you can see it in our selection as well). The interesting thing is when the coffee pot is turned into a tea pot it needs to be modified to fit the tea sock. The handle on the lid is unscrewed, the lid is flipped over, and the handle is screwed back on, turning what was a concave lid into a convex lid, therefore making room for the tea sock. Sounds complicated? Come in and we can show you. I think this is a great teapot; it makes more sense as a teapot than a coffee pot.
