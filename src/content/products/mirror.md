3.1" x 4.5"  
Tin &Â Mirror  
INDIA

<!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} -->

For most people in India not much is hidden from one's neighbor. Bathing and general grooming is commonly done out in the open and why not? Look at yourself with your eyes and behold! Do you have anything to be ashamed of? No. When you search to see into your own soul, you open the window of opportunity to see into the soul of mankind. In India, in the case of the mirror, one can see into one's own eyes and, by watching another looking into their own, one gains insight into mankind's eyes as well. Voyeurism.
