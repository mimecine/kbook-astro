80" x 3"  
Cotton & Wool  
SWEDEN

The waistband appears on Swedish costumes from practically every region. It varies slightly from area to area. This example is from the region of Dalarna and specifically the town of Leksand. Dalarna is centered on the lake of Siljan and as one drives around it, the regional costume changes both in a slight and dramatic way. The band is worn wrapped once around the waist and tied in a knot to the side so the balls hang down quite low to the ground. We sometimes double it so they do not hang as low or wear it as a necklace. The band is not handmade, but the balls are, and it is assembled to order by a grandmother. The tradition of the Swedish costume is still very strong in the area.
