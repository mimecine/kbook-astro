28.5" x 20.5"  
Hand Painted Paper  
HONG KONG

Not just a kite, a fighting kite! Although it flies just like your everyday kite, this kite is designed for aggressive activity! Back in the "real" fighting kite days, you took a pile of crushed glass and covered your glue-coated line in the shards; then you had competitions with your friends (or enemies) to see who could cut the other's line first. On days when no competitions were held, you took your kite to the beach and cut the lines of other kids' kites. These disgruntled kids became great enemies to compete with later. Here in the U.S. of A, we also compete, but with line touching. No sharp glass allowed! What nerds! Watch out or I'll touch you really, really hard! Every kite is hand-painted, so each is a bit different, and the color combinations vary as well. Comes as a set of two kites.
