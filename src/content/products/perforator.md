2.5" x 0.5" x 6"  
Metal, Plastic & 2 Cutting Blades  
JAPAN

It was the spring in Tokyo. The cherry blossoms had just bloomed, and we were visiting for a two-week research trip. I remember how the blossoms' falling made me think of pink bubblegum and cotton candy. We ate great food, we found inspiring things, and we had a super time, isolated mostly. We were having an opening, and a man came up to me with this tool. I thought it was for crafting. I'm not into it; I did not understand. He ran out, came back with a gigantic cardboard box, and proceeded to build a double-decker cat house with his perforating tool. Crafty, yes, but practical too, ideal for taking a large box half-filled with air and knocking it down to half the size quickly and neatly. Mike translated, and it all made sense, I think. The master cutter makes these perforators to order, one by one, himself, I think. I do know this is not a mass-produced item: each blade is unique and numbered. This is important. Damned expensive, but you can understand why and it pays for itself quickly. We use it at Kiosk all the time. Comes with two blades.
