8.25" x 10" x 7"  
Stainless Steel  
USA

You know one of those days when things get strange and then they get stranger? We were minding our own business in a very touristic restaurant in Boston (but actually, it was quite good - and who cares - we were tourists), sitting at communal tables, admiring this beautiful pitcher and eating cod, steamers and Indian pudding, when all of a sudden this older man - who claimed to be a judge - struck up a conversation with us. He seemed interesting at first and told us some funny stories about trials he oversaw, but then it got really special when he started to tell us about his marriage breaking apart and his young girlfriend and not wanting to divorce his wife for financial reasons and a very special ménages à trois - things were suddenly getting more than seedy. I thought to myself, "Oh Christ, not another weirdo! Can't we just talk about water pitchers?" We made haste and got the hell out of there, snapping a picture of the pitcher on the way out and hoping to god he did not remember our details. My friend, if you are out there - beware - this patriot pitcher will find its way to your noggin fast if you try any funny business at the KIOSK. These pitchers are based on a simple colonial form and used to be found in all the more established Bostonian establishments. The large rim funnels the water into a stream and pours perfectly.
