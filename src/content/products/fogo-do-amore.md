Magic Inside!  
COLOMBIA

It's passion at play in a very small bottle, and just like the Genie you better be careful when you uncork it. Its coy scent of motel shampoo twists and turns its way out of the container and into your room until it has taken over and possessed your thoughts, your nose. My friend Chris who went to Colombia - I have never been there - informed me only after I released the power from within, that what this product claims is quite positively, not 100% true! But, how? Do you remember the Genie in the bottle who would come and clean your floors? Somehow, she made her way to Colombia and on the way was transformed into a love potion. What a gift of love - at least the illustration can inspire if you want it to.
