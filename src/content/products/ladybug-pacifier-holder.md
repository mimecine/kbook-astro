10.5" x 1"  
Wood, Paint & Metal Clip  
GERMANY

Hey, we don't have kids, but I have seen plenty of adults suffer. Where is the pacifier? Kids love to exert some control and drop the goodie whenever they have the urge \- who wouldn't? I mean, if you were cooped up in a stroller, buckled in, wouldn't you want a little control too? With this wooden ladybug, let the child believe they can throw it all day long \- you'll only have a problem when they figure out how to unclip it from their jacket. My friend Ross says he wants a bunch of these for his 1 & 1/2 year old, so he can clip everything (snacks, bottle, hat, toys) onto him \- interesting, but the kid might look like a bit of an apparition \- wasn't the Ghost of Christmas Past loaded down with chains? A bit mystic...it could work.
