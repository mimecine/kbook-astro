Yves Yves Yves. Bowls bowls bowls. Yawn yawn yawn. I am tired. So I reach for an Yves Yves bowl bowl to make myself a hot hot coffee, and I drink out of the bowl bowl, and I want to tell Yves: thank you for your bowl. It makes each day, and sometimes night, and each coffee coffee, better better. The fact is, Yves' thinking and vision is uncommon. With time he has come to understand his clay, porcelain and glazes in rare combination like few others. His ability to look into nature and recreate the essence what he sees so directly is so profound that when I look at his bowls I don't see glaze and technique. I see moss and the earth and, like nature, on every glance something has silently modified so it appears new and different again. Not bad in a bowl, especially if it holds my coffee coffee at 8am!
