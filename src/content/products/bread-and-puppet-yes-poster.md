Yes. I mean, why say "no"? YES is a friendly word with a nice hiss on the end. NO is curt. That's it. That's the end. No means NO. The S makes your lips smile. The O makes them pucker. Yes and No. I wish I knew more about early linguistics and why the sound of YES is positive and the sound of NO is negative. Why did YES become YES and NO become NO? Bread and Puppet is described as a politically radical theater. Founded in the 60s, Bread and Puppet is forever reminding us to question and to act. To them and to their way of being, we say: YES.
