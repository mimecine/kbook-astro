We have had these as an element in the store since we opened, thanks to Ross Menuez and his great ideas. Jorgensen clamps have been a standard in woodworking shops for a hundred years and they continue to be synonymous with the word "clamp." They were invented in 1900 by a man named... Jorgensen, who partnered up with A. V. Holman, an opera singer and businesswoman. (Possibly they were having an affair in the workshop?) By 1903, Holman purchased Jorgensen's interest in the company and Jorgensen stopped the opera touring and went back to building cabinets. Dan Holman, the great-great-grandson of A.V., is the owner today and his son Doug will take over in a few years. Not only have we seen these clamps in our own studio, we have seen them at Lowell's Boat Shop in Amesbury, Massachusetts, among other places, - they were beat up and just as beautiful as the boats they were producing. You don't necessarily have to use them for woodworking; we use them anywhere you can't nail or screw into - often the case in rental apartments or sublets. Think about it. Price break on a set.
