200 yds.  
Cotton Thread & Plastic  
HONG KONGÂ 

This is what a kite needs to fly. You know you need a line. You need some string. It's what a left shoe would be to a right shoe, or a hand to a glove. It comes in plenty of pretty electric colors, each better than the last. If you have a favorite color let us know! This string is made for lightweight kites, like the fighter one we stock; although I have never tried, I would love to dip the line in crushed glass, if not to cut my opponent's line, just for the shimmering effect. Don't forget gloves and protective glasses. You already forgot your common sense somewhere when you started the whole thing! Oh, screw it. Just go fly a kite and call it a day.
