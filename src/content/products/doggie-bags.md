Boy oh boy! Do I have to beg for my supper? And what about my friends on the back of the bag? Do they need to get up and do the tricks too? It's a tough racket, how do you think I feel not being able to feed myself? Do you think I like being codependent? As Annie, or her dog (I bet it was the dog) said, "It's a hard-knock life." Last seen at John G's in West Palm Beach. Seen all over Florida, up and down the East Coast: doggie bags for elephant-sized portions of food. I wonder if in some parts of the country they sell XL doggie bags. Hey.... it's not a bag idea.
