9" x 5.75" x 1"  
Stoneware  
FRANCE

Steam heat makes apartments dry and hot. Luckily, there is a solution. Le Humidifier! It hangs on the side of the radiator and requires no electricity, just water at regular intervals. The stoneware is not sealed with any glaze, which makes it porous and allows the steam to spread out. It's really perfect: attractive, traditional, and functional, I like that. Before we found this lovely object I used to leave my favorite device on - our veggie steamer, le Vita Saveur, magnifique! - to steam the rooms. Stupid, you think! Why not buy a humidifier! But why? Why not have two for one! My only slight dilemma is how to get this one to steam veggies, as my Vita Saveur is no more; no matter what I do, I can't get it to work. Strange, no? Maybe I should just break the rules and buy a separate steamer for my dietary needs? What do you think? Is it OK to bend the rules this time?
