3.5"ø x 4"   
Clay & Glaze  
MEXICO

I have admired this type of pottery for years and often searched for it in New York but did not have any luck. I think I first spotted this type of cup in a still from the Eames' film "Day of the Dead," the villagers were using them to drink atole. To me they were so uncommonly basic I really wanted a set, this was during the heyday of Pottery Barn and I was yearning for something different. When I started researching Mexico I remembered this type of ceramic, which led me to Michoacán, a region known for its ceramic production, and then to a ceramic market in the village of Pátzcuaro. Even though the tourist market was relatively tourist-free, the goods were very geared to the tourist industry (more on Michoacán later). I found one woman whose family made these cups and the other ones available here. At the market they were sold on a piece of rope for easy transportation home. Please note they are not damaged but do have an occasional chip or mark, good character!
