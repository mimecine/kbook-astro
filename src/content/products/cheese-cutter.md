6.5"

ROMANIA

Cheese, pleeeze...we had only landed 2 hours prior and were already on the hunt for food. None of us had any idea what we would find, searching for Romanian food online proves little results. Our hosts gave kind, but vague and very Romanian, directions to the local market. "It's called Gemeni Market and it's just up the road, a few blocks to the right." When you're hungry after 12 hours of traveling, it's getting dark and there is not a place in sight to eat, the sweat starts to pour. We could not pronounce it, but we found it. The market was soon closing, so we ran around at a good clip. Plums, red peppers, cabbage, apples, apple cider (we guessed), little cucumbers, garlic, glorious-looking bread, butter (or was it lard? it was butter), tiny dried sausages, eggs (so fresh), walnuts. And then the cheese - this lady stood out. She was large and solid, like a block herself - there were about 4-5 different cheeses in her shop, all of them white. No one spoke English, we were on our own with only two words between us 4: da - which means "yes" in Romanian and she could say please - but not the way we say it - it was drawn out and pressing, like a wheeze. She said "_pleeze_, would we try her delicious _cheeze, pleeze_," as she passed the knife with a sample again and again. Not knowing how to say _nu_ ("no") we went home with cheese to last two weeks. Take a note, when in Bucharest go to Gemeni Market and if you need a place to stay, let us know.
