SWEDEN

You know what? Our job is NOT easy! You may think it is and we are having a good-olde fun time, and sure we love having the shop and finding all of these things but sometimes it is a god da\*n pain in the a\*s. Getting this bag was a prime example. When we thought of Sweden we knew we had to have it, there was no question. It was the epitome of what Sweden can be at its best moments. It's all about nature and camping and all good things in between. The bag comes in 3 sizes - we are stocking two. Swedes use it from cradle to deathbed, it's common, so we always wondered, “Why is it not here?” in America that is...Then we tried to buy it and we understood why. Three weeks of pretty persistent phone calls led to no replies and then a sudden, "We are not interested in doing business" email...what the \- ?! We were offended and confused, so we got on the phone and asked to speak to whomever runs the place - we got the VP of the company on the line and had it out. He agreed to supply us with one shipment, but that was all! They had no interest in selling them as, they “have a good enough business as it is.” Try the bag for yourself and see why it is as popular in Sweden as plastic bags are here in the USA!
