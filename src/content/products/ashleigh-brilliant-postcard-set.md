5.5" x 3.5" each card  
Paper  
USA

It's not easy for me to write about a writer. I have a hard time commenting. I remember when Jason first showed me Ashleigh's work; it was 2008. This has been a long time in the works. With 10,000+ "potshots," as he calls them, under his belt - and all of them under copyright - I am afraid to put his writing down here. This sample pack of Mr. Brilliant's work includes some chosen by Marco and some by me. My favorite is "Everyone is Entitled to My Opinion" © Ashleigh Brilliant, Marco's is "Help! I am in Desperate Need of Some Overwhelming Pleasure" © Ashleigh Brilliant. I think that sums each of us up pretty well. I have to hand it to Ashleigh, he writes good stuff that I savor. Set of 33 cards. You guess who chose what.
