Unridged gnocchi is so passé. Grow up, get a ridge, Gnoch! Want to make your own? You need this board unless you long to keep your guests waiting and watching for hours until 11 at night, while you hand roll hopelessly on a cutting board. Our kitchen was small so I was eye to eye with our company as their faces grew longer and longer and their stomachs became smaller and smaller. Humor them as I may in our 10 square foot room (including kitchen, table and chairs) my song and dance, although powerful and hypnotic, was only good for so long. The gnocchi went into the pot in fact, just before they said SO LONG for the night, perhaps for good. The little clouds were delicious in the end but the wait, the wait! It was a farce. About halfway through I longed for this board, yet I did not tell anyone. Today, mechanical gnocchi production in the making. Take the dough like me and roll down into delicate little lumps of delight!
