13"/11"Ã¸  
Rubber & Nylon  
THE NETHERLANDS

A rain cap that covers the neck - you need it with all the rain they get in the Netherlands. We get rain here too - the world needs rain, the world needs sunshine on our shoulders and rain off our necks. Four sizes - S is for kids, M is for big kids/little adults, L is for your standard adult, XL is for big guys, although take my advice for what it is - it's all a gross generalization. A Dutch icon made, in fact, in Germany. Who is to say where borders stop and begin and what does a little bit of water between lands have to do with anything? The oceans cover more than 70% of our planet and 97% of the earth's water is in our oceans.1% of the earth's water is fresh, 65% of you is water - keep all that water off your neck, ya hear?
