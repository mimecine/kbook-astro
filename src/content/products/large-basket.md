13" x 17"Ã¸  
Bamboo, Plastic Straps & Steel Wire  
HONG KONG

Ubiquitous, these baskets are found everywhere in Hong Kong. I mean everywhere. It is likely the most-repeated object I have yet to see in any country. They were at the street markets and in food shops, pharmacies, and pet stores; most notably, they were used at construction and deconstruction sites to gather debris before lugging it to a waiting truck. We suspect the construction cast-offs end up in the sea as part of the (in)famous land reclamation going on. More than 10% of the developed land area in Hong Kong has been reclaimed from the sea and efforts are continuing every day. It's really a wonder in engineering; the only uncertainty is they are not sure how the environment will be affected, particularly the groundwater... what had access to the sea is now landlocked. Possible issue.
