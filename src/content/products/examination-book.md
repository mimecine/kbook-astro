Paper  
USA

I vaguely remember examination books when I was in college \- Jiyoni, who works with us, said they still use them up at Vassar. Jonathan walked into my office, held the one on my desk in his hands, looked at it and said "NO", \- not in an aggressive way, but with a hint of fear and trepidation. It was a trigger object and I knew we had to get it. College students, if we can help you cheat on your exams by providing you with these babies, please come on down! I am not a big believer in proving one's knowledge through cramming and pressured examinations \- we are here to help!
