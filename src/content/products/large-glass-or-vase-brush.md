17"  
Palm, Wire & Bamboo  
JAPAN

The shop this brush comes from was established in 1869 in Kyoto - today it stands in the same location with the same appearance. The brooms and brushes they sell are created by some of the last traditional broom makers in Kyoto. They are increasingly hard to find and considered to be a rarity. The shop does not ship, nor does it supply to any other stores. It is a hand-tied hemp palm, or shuro-boki brush. The handle is made of stained bamboo. It is incredibly durable and is said to last for up to 20 years with the proper care.
