7" x 12.5"  
Tin  
PORTUGAL

I am the king of toast. Sometimes I manage to eat toast three or four times a day. My honey likes toast too. Not just in a romantic, breakfast-in-bed kind of way, but also in a snacky kind of way. Snacks and romance? What more does one need? This model doesn't require electricity (don't you already have a stove?), it won't havecollect piles of crumbs in the bottom of it, and you can just hang it on the wall when you're done. Does not take up counter or cabinet space, very difficult for it to break down.
