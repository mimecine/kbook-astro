7" x 2"  
Raw Cast Aluminum  
MEXICO

Juice Juice keeps you strong. Juice Juice all day long. Well, maybe not lime juice, so this song may not apply here. This is a great kitchen device. I have seen them in the States and I saw many different kinds in Mexico but this one that we found during the sprawling weekly market in Toluca stood out from the literally 1,000,000-plus products available that day. To use it is really easy: hold the juicer over what you want the juice to go on/in, place half a lime in the scoop face down, and press. It really is easy and gets every last drop of juice out of the fruit. Given that Mexicans use lime in about 80% of their recipes, you can be certain they have perfected this device. Just trust me on this one! By the way, do you know that the word "lime" derives from the Persian word "Limu" and that the fruit was introduced to Europe during the Crusades?
