Wax  
PORTUGAL

When I was young we sent out Christmas cards and each of us had our own wax seal. It was a bit snooty or silly for my sister and I to seal our cards with wax, but it looked really beautiful on my mother's card. Perhaps it was because she used an antique seal, although in the mid-1980s she switched over to "Merry Christmas!" for a short period of time, right about when "The Silver Palate" cookbook became popular. In the past, sealed contracts were just that, sealed, with wax. The seal indicated a certain amount of deliberation but also generally proved the signer was present with their unique seal, often a ring on their finger. I inherited my mother's seal and I really enjoy using it. However, finding the right red WITHOUT sparkle has proven difficult. Then I came across the "777-bull-dog" wax, THE END, problem solved. A bright red seal will find its way onto every holiday card this year.
