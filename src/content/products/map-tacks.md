Still a family-owned business, Moore Push-Pins was established in 1900 by Edwin Moore with a mere $112.60. Like many inventors and entrepreneurs, he worked day and night building his business based on pins. Why pins? No one seems to know, but Mr. Moore is credited with inventing push-pins as well as map tacks. Alas, paper maps are steadily being replaced by digital maps, and with their departure, map tacks are also heading the way of the robin. However, as a big believer in using things for anything but their "proper" use, I find these tacks really handy for helping prioritize tasks around the house. At the start of the week every task gets a number: Hair needs cutting? Number the scissors. Change the shower curtain? Number it. Take out the compost? Number it. Very handy and practical, indeed! I am sure you will find some interesting things to number, or maybe you'll use them like push-pins after all! Comes with numbers 1 to 25, so with this system you can only take on 25 tasks a week, at most!
