We had one of these Bell Straps on our front door when I was growing up. It made it hard to sneak in and out after curfew. Now, I'm not saying that's why the bells were there year-round, but I can say I don't remember them being there year-round until I was a teenager. Until then they were only taken out at Christmas, as they are sleigh bells and they added some festive noise to the home. Maybe the whole thing was a coincidence, maybe not. I have read online that someone trained their dog to shake the strap when it needed to go out. That's funny. Horses have been decorated with bells since Roman times to denote wealth and to ward off disease and evil. Every object has myriad uses. The bells have a nice medium tone; we were quite thorough in choosing the sound we felt was best. The pattern is historical and comes from New England.
