Cast Iron & Japanese Stamp Ink  
JAPAN

<!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} -->

A persimmon is not a tomato,  
but both are “true berries”  
and both grow in Japan and America -  
the eastern part of America,  
to be specific.  
Today, I saw one by coincidence  
growing in the park at Bowery and Houston.  
I was amazed.  
Inside this persimmon is red ink,  
a vermilion color as red as the  
outside.  
In Japan, seals are very common.  
Inkan and Hanko, some are as valid as  
a signature.  
Ink stamps are also common,  
one I really like is a Meisho stamp.  
You find them at many landmarks.  
Used to stamp the inside of your notebook  
and have an immediate souvenir.  
Even at subway stations! That was cool!  
To me, this is the best souvenir.  
A cheap, easy memory of a place -  
totally democratic.  
This ink makes me think of such.
