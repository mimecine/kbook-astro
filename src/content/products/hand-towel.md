INDIA

You're hot, you're sweating, you stumble into Khadi Bhandar in Madurai. You're confused- slightly- its 38 degrees Celsius, that is 97 degrees Fahrenheit. Fahrenheit 451, you think to yourself. The power is out in the city and it's hard to cross the street where the rickshaw dropped you off. It's day two in the travels. It's barely cooler inside but it's khadi inside- Gandhiji's solution to India's problems. Every village should spin their own fabric, every person should govern themselves, every village should govern itself, be self reliant, the country of India should govern itself, Swaraj. "The spinning wheel represents to me the hope of the massesâ€¦it brings about a silent and sure revolution." - Mahatma Gandhi. Oh so good, oh so fast drying, oh so Indian. I wish I had a Towel Tower.
