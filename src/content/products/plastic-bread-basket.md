Plastic  
ROMANIA

Tan plastic is not the most endearing but somehow, in Romania, it is a true vestige of Communism, perhaps one of the few good things left from that time. We were noshing on this delicious bread made with potato, when we could find it - thick, dense stuff with a really decent crust on it. Butter was hard to find, but when we had the two in cahoots the toaster came out and it was time to get down. An even more special treat was called salată de icre, very much like taramosalata, made with carp or herring roe. The carp variant is called _CRAP_ and we all had a laugh at the grocery. There is also a Romanian dish called _KROTCH_.
