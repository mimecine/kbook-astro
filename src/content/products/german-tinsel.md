10.5" x 4"  
Aluminum  
GERMANY

Have you ever spent Christmas in Florida? Do they really have tinsel trees and decorate with shells? This is what I have been told. I wonder what they do for tinsel? Is it a silver-on-silver theme or does one use seaweed instead? The Germans invented tinsel - it is nothing like the common variant in the United States. German tinsel holds its shape and has a different appearance all together, much classier. Lametta (tinsel) was first made in Germany in the 1600s, it began as silver and then progressed to pewter, which is a tin alloy, hence, the word "tinsel." Today, it is mostly produced in aluminum.
