Well, hello, sugar and all sorts of other yummy things. Ricos was founded in 1968 by a Cuban family. I love the packaging. Chiviricos are heavy, meringues are not. I don't have a Cuban grandmother, but I have been told Rico's Chiviricos taste like the ones Cuban grandmas make. If you have a Cuban grandma who makes chiviricos ask for a taste and let us know; if you have a grandpa who eats them, let us know! We actually made the best discovery with the meringues when we were traveling. After about two days in our cooked-up car, I found they transformed into a really unique texture. While they still held their shape, they deflated upon biting, much like you would expect a powder-puff mushroom to respond. Far superior to any marshmallow. If you are a wheat-free person, let us know and we can send you meringues only. They are a great wheat-free sweet.
