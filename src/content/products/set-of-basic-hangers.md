15.5" x 8"  
Wood & Metal  
MEXICO

The hanger in its purest form, what would Mommie Dearest say? I am not certain if this is progressive or regressive. These were found at the super-huge market in Toluca, north of Mexico City. Handmade by the man who was selling them, they are rough and tough. I saw a similar design at another market in Mexico City but I never saw these in anyone's house, I think people prefer plastic. I find these exotic and interesting; never thought I'd use those words for a hanger!
