5" long each  
Metal Wire  
MEXICO

Marco and I were rushing to a store in downtown Mexico City when we came across Alfonso and his work. OK, I had seen variations on these before and we were late but I had to stop; he was so dedicated to his work it was refreshing. He offered about 25 different variations so it was hard to choose. Being that he was the maker he could solve each one with relative ease, I on the other hand am still struggling with the "A" for easy category. You could see Alfonso had a bit of magic in him. Metal puzzles should be called "pacifiers" for their power to distract, good on car trips, or if you are late for a meeting give one to the person waiting for you outside your office. For that matter, all doctor's offices should have a pile.
