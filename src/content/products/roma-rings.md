0.75"Ã¸, adjustable!  
Metal & Plastic  
ROMANIA

I never haggle. But when the colorful Roma woman selling me these told me two prices over the course of two sentences, I figured I was in my full right to. The husband magically appeared and the price-quantity-quality negotiation was in full bloom. How many rings did they have? Was it even worth counting? I pulled out my cash. Wait, a third are broken! The man starts pulling bills out of my hands! I pull them back! After the money involuntary changed hands several times and another batch of mostly broken rings showed up, we settled on a price that was disappointingly acceptable for us both and I let the bills rest in the man's hand. A shot of tuica was offered with smiles and the woman told me how easy it was to fix the broken rings and sent me off with another batch of half-broken rings in addition to the ones I got.
