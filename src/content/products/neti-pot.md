6" x 3"  
Plastic  
INDIA

I was pleased when I found a simple, plastic neti pot for travel, you need one in the more polluted parts of our planet. This neti is produced by a man who owns a metal cookware shop. I discovered his hobby when I randomly asked him if he knew where I could find one. "Something" told me I should ask him. (Is there a Deity of Sinuses in the Hindu religion, out of the 330 million deities? Whom should I thank for this help?) No matter what the uninformed say, the neti pot is not the same as having a colonic. So, if you tell them you use one, and they look at you strange, let them know: the tip of the neti goes in your nose. Mine is indispensable, and yes, it does make a difference in how you feel in the morning. You know how when you brush your teeth at night, you wake up feeling fresher and more clear in your mouth; using the neti, you wake up feeling fresher and more clear in your head. It's true! Come on! Don't be a wimp. Comes with instructions. Excellent for sinuses and cheap too. Nasal irrigation has its roots in Ayurvedic medicine established in the mid-second millennium BCE.
