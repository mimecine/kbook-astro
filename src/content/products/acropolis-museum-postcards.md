Paper  
GREECE

One can imagine, correctly, that the Acropolis Museum is simply a-maz-ing, (not so much for the building, by Bernard Tschumi, which has faced some controversy \- understandably, as it does resemble a shopping mall). It’s the content, which cannot be outdone, with or without the Elgin (Parthenon) marbles (hopefully with, soon). What better way to document a visit to this $200 million structure than with postcards of its workers at work? Images of a modern creation in process? Man’s great gift of architecture under way? Which way to look? Up or down, forward or back? It’s a constant question in Athens, and in Greece. When I came across these after three hours of studying antiquity, I found them to be a poetic way to consider today’s worker.
