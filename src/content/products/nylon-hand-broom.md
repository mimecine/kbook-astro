4.5" x 12"  
Nylon & Plastic  
PORTUGAL

Sweeping, dusting, chores can be so dull and time-consuming. For this reason I make sure I have the prettiest hand brooms, brushes, dusters, mops, buckets, towels, and dish brushes around, as well as the best ecological cleaning products. I have found this broom to be useful for the shelves at KIOSK, which get quite dusty within a few hours' time. The nylon bristle flips the dust straight off the shelf. It makes me think of the nice big brushes previously used at drafting tables. Not that it is the same shape, but it serves the same purpose. We saw this hand broom being used at Bordalo Pinheiro where each item gets hand-dusted before it is packed. I also noticed it was used in all of the traditional Portuguese shops for dusting their shelves and countertops. Good for bookshelves, too. Wallace Carothers, who invented nylon in 1935, married a woman called Helen Sweetman (they don't make names like they used to). At the age of 41 he committed suicide by drinking a lemon juice laced with cyanide; at the time of his death he felt he had not done enough with himself.
