5.5" x 4" / 3.5 oz  
Coffee & Chicory Root  
INDIA

A finely ground blend of coffee and chicory root for a very distinctly Indian caffeinated experience. When you had enough of that iced-shaked-triple-soy-double-cortado made from monkey-pooped javanese rare medium-roasted bean and you are ready to move on. Indian coffee is widely considered to be the best shade grown coffee in the world. Shade grown being better as it more commonly uses the natural habitat, which results in a better environment for bird life and less necessity for chemicals in the growing process. Coffee is the second most traded commodity in the world, right behind number one: OIL. Funny how we are all devotees of thick brown stuff. The first coffee was smuggled out of the Middle East by Baba Budan, a 17th century Sufi who, while on a pilgrimage to Mecca, smuggled back seven - a holy number - coffee beans to India. Coffee was a coveted commodity at the time and the Arab world had tight control on it - it was forbidden to export green coffee beans. From India, it spread to Italy, then the rest of Europe, to Indonesia through the Dutch, and then to the Americas. Ravi's was recommended to us by some local friends. Use the Ravi's with a filter, not in a coffee machine. If you like coffee, this is another option to add to your never-ending journey into the world of coffee consumption.
