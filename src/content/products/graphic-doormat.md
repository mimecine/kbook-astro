I first noticed this doormat  
at Noda Horo -they make enameled things.  
We visited and admired their assembly line,  
in their compact and amazingly functional factory with the  
tiny house structures the products hung from and their  
long furnace which burned bright red. When I looked at it  
I kept repeating to myself, "Holy Smoke."  
The doormat was not made by them nor nearby.  
But somehow, like me, someone found it and placed it at their  
Entrance.  
I looked at it and thought of the neon in our entrance  
as the pattern is much the same  
and considered how both things are at entrances.  
Mr. Horo took us for soba in the countryside  
and Marco learned how the owner makes dashi.  
So many things behind one doormat.
