12" x 5"  
Paper Mach√© & Paint  
MEXICO

More than one woman who grew up in Mexico has said to me that this type of doll is from her childhood. Produced from 19th century molds the dolls naturally have become less and less common in Mexico as industry has taken over. The dolls I came across most often had red hair, never blond, but sometimes brown or black. My guess is red hair is considered most exotic, as it is. The dolls often have a name painted on the front of their bodies; I have read this is because they represent prostitutes. I am not sure of the validity of this connection, however scantily clad the girls are. Something really interesting to me is the painting style, as it resembles the traditional "kurbits" painting technique from Sweden. You can see what you think by looking at the Dala Horse card in our Sweden section. We are all interconnected. Every doll is unique.
