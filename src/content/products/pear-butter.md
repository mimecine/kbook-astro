8 oz.  
Pears, Sugar, Orange Zest &Â Spices  
USA

The apple has had its day and straight marmalade is kind of sour. Dip your cheese wedge into this jar and sing the praises of the mighty pear. It will be like when you get a haircut and then you notice how many people have great haircuts, too. That bottom? Pear shaped. That's not a lonely tear, it's a juicy pear. Ever picked a juicy pear from a tree, squeezed some fresh orange peel on it, and dusted it with a secret spice mix? I didn't think so. But now you can have that kind of taste sensation whenever you want, whenever this jar is near. Maybe you should keep it in your bag for when you come across a lonely piece of toast. Made by the same great people who brought you that apple chutney you can't let go of, you know the one.
