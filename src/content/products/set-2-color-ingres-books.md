Paper, Metal & Cotton Twill Tape  
JAPAN

These notebooks come in two sizes and are filled with a range of pastel colors. They're perfect as a photo album, scrapbook or just a plain old, beautiful gift. Hard cover with a fabric tie. Approximately 25 pages per book. We get a lot of questions about the name. In the 1980s, it was common for J-English (Japanese-English) to run amok. These days, sadly, it has all been corrected. Gone are the days when a tough guy, going to the corner 7-11, would be wearing his girlfriend's slippers and a t-shirt saying "I Rike Young Boy!" The cute thing about this very serious Japanese company is that they either don't know about the implications of their name, or they don't care. Either way, these are great notebooks with high quality paper.
