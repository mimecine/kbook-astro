Adult and Children's Sizes  
Hand-Knit Wool  
USA

Talk about grandma's mittens, these are them. I mean, literally, a grandma really does make them from wool spun and dyed at a mill in Maine. I had a very industrious grandma and mom who were always knitting or sewing something of some sort, and usually there was a new set of mittens, scarf, and hat every year. For some reason, these items in particular were always stored in a Hoover vacuum box from the 1920s. This box, probably due to its age, became a magical object in our home, a type of treasure chest, but instead of gold it held all sorts of hand-knitted things, and it always sat on the shelf in the hall closet by the front door. We used to go through the box every year, seeing what still fit and looking for matches and new combinations. My younger sister inherited a lot of odd pairs due to my neglect. Today that box is at my sister's in her hall closet, and our mittens are waiting for the next generation's use. I still insist on going through it every winter, searching for the grail.
