8.5" x 7"Ã¸  
Plexiglas  
USA

Florida has all these different fabulous aspects about it. One thing for sure is the East Coast and the West Coast are two very different places, with a little crossover between the two. Sarasota is a special town, with very special mid-century architecture and a lot of pools and a lot of ice buckets. Driving around on an architectural tour after staying in the predominately pink Helmsley Sandcastle Hotel on the beach - glorious - I was staring at all the bougainvillea and the homes with their tidy driveways and found myself fantasizing about women in muumuus wearing sunglasses and turbans hosting afternoon card parties by the pool. Note: it was not a sexual daydream, just a fabulous moment akin to the beginning of the movie "The Swimmer." This ice bucket hails from Florida and is certainly the product of someone having one of those daydreams.
