Let it ride. You may think the kids in your life are over this: mechanics, hoisting, pulling, pushing, balancing things and making them work. But you know, your wrong. Kids today are not only about the digital domain. Just because we say that's what they are into, does not mean that's what they are into. The media tells us people want to read smut, so they give us smut. But really, does everyone want smut? Kids want to work with their hands. They want to make things and get physical. What we need to do is help them explore this process. Kids will take what we provide and run with it. Provide them with something good. Take the time to enjoy it with them. It's a win-win. Â Age 10+
