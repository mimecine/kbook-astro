5 oz.  
100% Maple Syrup  
USA

Have you been to Vermont? If not, then I doubt you have ever heard of the famous Vermont maple cows that make the famous Vermont maple butter. Those cows are fed nothing but hay coated with maple syrup for the first three years of their lives. Those little guys are so cute, "sweet" one could say. The farmer tests the milk with a maplometer until he gets a reading of equal parts maple and milk. When the balance is right, the wheels go into motion for making maple butter. The cows are quickly milked and maple butter is produced. Ah-ha, if you read this far then I gotcha! Maple butter, my friend, is simply whipped maple syrup, and - if you can imagine it - is oh so good. Ours is made by Marie P. Michaud, a French-speaking grandma who lives way up at the top of Vermont. Keep refrigerated.
