Sugar  
THE NETHERLANDS

Part of a sentence on each bonbon \- match the ends and then use Google translate to know what they say! The word _ijs_, being "ice" had me assume these bonbons were a mint flavor of the wintergreen persuasion. Boy, was I confused when I tried one. First strawberry, then pineapple, later, a touch of citrus. The bottom line is these candies are sugar and whatever flavor you add to them makes them whatever flavor you want them to be. Now what happens when you layer flavors? Is that possible? Have the Dutch created a multi-flavor layer candy or...? I have concluded this flavor sensation has something to do with the various wrapper colors.
