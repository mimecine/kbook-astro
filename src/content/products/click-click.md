6" x 24" x 1"  
Wood, Paint & Metal  
PORTUGAL

A roller with teeth to grab the road and make noises. It clicks and clacks as you roll it along. A pretty flower. We visited the family who makes this toy; the father looks like Geppetto. We checked out his storage next to the workshop; you should have seen how lovely a hundred of these looked together. I don't know how they produce everything they do, with only two people and machines that are more than 100 years old. Their bandsaw looked like a sideboard, because the bottom half was! The toys must come to life and help, it was the only explanation I could find. The click-click flowers become pretty maids with aprons and brooms sweeping the studio. The toys at Walmart are so sad trapped in their boxes and plastic. Boo hoo hoo.
