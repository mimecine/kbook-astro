Polyester Pile & Plastic  
COLOMBIA

One can make an argument that members of political parties are just like sheep, following their leaders wherever they go. Herded en masse, they wave their banners and shout their slogans. But just like these little sheep, what are they really thinking? Looking into the eyes of the sheep / followers, what do you find? Do you find anything? Do they hear you? Little sheep around the cr√®che at Christmas, little politician followers around the podium. When my friend Chris was in Colombia he found these tiny hand-painted sheep with their jacket lining castoff coats and thought to himself -come back little sheep to the world of KIOSK, let's start working together to make my country a better place. When I go to Colombia I am going to find the makers of these sheep and talk to them about politics.
