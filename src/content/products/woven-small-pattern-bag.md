In the small community of Bangli, we worked with Kadek on multiple projects to weave bags and carpets, a skill she normally dedicates to religious objects. We were inspired by the inventive ways the Balinese carried every day objects and were compelled to make a collection of objects for carrying. It took repeated visits and great negotiation to convince Kadek to take on our commissions, her reluctance stemming from a fear of failure. We were privileged to have the crafters step outside of their daily routine and truly experiment, as it is extremely uncommon.
